8. Fixes/Changed in the WinUAE version:
=======================================
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.8 Release 7 - August 5, 1999
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Displaying the GUI and then dragging it around no longer "erases" the
         background.  Even works in full-screen mode (finally).
- FIXED: More changes to source-code archive, and more information online at
         http://www.CodePoet.com/UAE/source.htm
- FIXED: No longer allow Zorro-III memory sizes larger than 64-megs, due to
         stability issues.
- ADDED: More debug information about the type of surfaces that DirectDraw is
         creating.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.8 Release 6 - August 3, 1999
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Picasso96 screen-modes are now limited by the amount of RTG memory
         which has been allocated.  This way, if the user has selected 1-meg
         of RTG memory, they can't try and open a 1600x1200 24-bit display.
- FIXED: TCP/IP Networking from within WinUAE works better for some cases.
- FIXED: .dms files FINALLY work again, provided that xdms.exe is available
         on your system.
- FIXED: Creating a new drawer from Workbench and changing its default name
         no longer crashes.
- FIXED: File-system bugs like renaming, and some obscure problems regarding
         sub-directories being in-use and undeletable, even when they're not.
- FIXED: Obscure bug relating to the 'a' bit (archive-bit) as seen with the
         AmigaDOS PROTECT command.
- FIXED: And yet more file-system bugs.
- FIXED: Option to disable sound when WinUAE is minimized wouldn't properly
         restart sound when WinUAE became visible again.
- FIXED: MIDI selection is only available in the GUI when serial-emulation
         has been enabled.
- FIXED: Second joystick button now works properly for some games which
         didn't initialize the POTGO register correctly.  (B.C. Kid)
- FIXED: Speedup in windowed-mode file-system access, due to use of a
         DirectDraw Clipper, and not parsing the clip-list manually.
         NOTE: This may cause a slow-down on some systems???  Feedback!
- FIXED: Source-archive has been properly updated to include some missing
         files.
- ADDED: DirectX 6.x support for a Picasso96 speed increase.  This also lets
         people have different refresh-rates for full-screen mode, as
         opposed to the old version's 60Hz limitation.
- ADDED: DirectSoundNotification support, for better double-buffered
         DirectSound under Win98 and Win2000 (if sound-card supports it).
- ADDED: Refresh of the window while dragging the GUI around on top of it.
         Only works in windowed-mode for now.  Fullscreen with a GUI will
         still result in black painting.
- ADDED: Support for serial-on-demand (shared serial-port) in the GUI.
         NOTE: Untested.  Feedback!
- ADDED: Enforcer-hits generate a beep and flash the window.
- ADDED: Amiga In A Box (AIAB) link in About tab of GUI.
- ADDED: About tab of GUI has a nicer look.
- CHANGED: Line-mode default is "Doubled", so that the proper height screens
           are displayed by default.
- CHANGED: Compile options and some source-code, for a speed increase and
           size decrease.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.8 Release 5 - May 15, 1999
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Picasso96 screen-problem involving mouse-pointers, refreshes, etc.
- FIXED: MIDI port-selection is disabled in the GUI once WinUAE is running.
- FIXED: Source-archive has been properly updated to include some missing
         files.
- ADDED: Instructions on where to get the HtmlHelp system.
- ADDED: Warning about HtmlHelp not being installed on the machine will only
         be given when the user uses the Help button for a page of the GUI.
- ADDED: ShapeShifter 'PrepareEmul' support, so you don't have to KickShift
         your ROM-images.  This also allows Amiga Forever users (which have
         encrypted ROM-images which can't be KickShift'ed) to use Shape-
         Shifter.
         NOTE: If you don't know what ShapeShifter is, or what 'PrepareEmul'
               is, then don't use this option!
- ADDED: Enforcer-like logging, so that memory accesses to location zero can
         be tracked by WinUAE.  A log will be generated with the complete CPU
         state (registers, program-counter, etc.).  This should ONLY be used
         during software development by experienced Amiga developers.
- CHANGED: HtmlHelp file is in seperate archive now.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.8 Release 4 - April 20, 1999
==============================================================================
- FIXED: MUI installation will now work.
- FIXED: Serial-port detection routine was partially broken.
- FIXED: Zorro-III memory sizes greater than 64-Megs now work.
- ADDED: WinUAE now remembers the last path where an .hdf file was selected.
         NOTE: This was already done for .rom and .adf files.
- ADDED: Selection of MIDI device in the I/O Ports page of the GUI.
- ADDED: First cut of Online-Help system.
- ADDED: Installer no longer creates any registry keys, since WinUAE will do
         this itself when run for the first time.  Additionally, this fixes
         the problems of those users running WinUAE off of a central network
         file-server install, where a local install of WinUAE had not been
         done.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.8 Release 3 - April 20, 1999
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Bug in new DX_FillRect() function, which affected DX_Blit().
- FIXED: Bug in MIDI speed-detection.  Bars'n'Pipes works now!
- FIXED: Bug in MIDI setup - I never set the MIDI output volume.
- FIXED: Auto-detect of VPOSW register changes has been cleaned up (from Toni)
- FIXED: Only serial-ports that exist on the PC will show up in the GUI - no
         more hardcoded COM1 - COM4.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.8 Release 2 - April 15, 1999
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Bizarre error with hardfiles, config-files, kickstart ROMs, and other
         areas.  Some places in the code were fopen() a file, and never
         releasing the file-handle for later use.
- FIXED: I *think* I've found the bug which was causing slow-downs on Cyrix
         processors.
- FIXED: Serial-port set to "none" always produced "COM1".
- FIXED: Command-line now accepts the old "-config=blah.uae" format, so that
         Amiga Forever users can just drop in the new WinUAE.exe and still use
         their MenuBox to start.  This also gave us a smaller executable!
- FIXED: 24-bit display-mode support should work again.
- FIXED: FPS display updates quicker when toggling between PAL and NTSC, since
         it now averages just the last 128 frames.
- FIXED: LED display in full-screen was corrupting Picasso screens, and would
         sometimes overwrite the Amiga graphics.  LED display is now only
         available in full-screen Amiga screens (not Picasso screens), and
         only when the resolution is at least 800x600.
- FIXED: Bug with PAL/NTSC control through VPOS register of custom-chips.
- FIXED: HTML links in the About panel of the GUI are now up-to-date.
- FIXED: Source-archive is now up-to-date, and includes a proper VisualC++ 6.0
         project for doing debug-builds.
- ADDED: Automatic MIDI output for Amiga software, such that when they select
         the MIDI baudrate, the serial-port output support stops sending bytes
         to a COM-port, and redirects outgoing MIDI bytes to the default
         Windows MIDI-out device.  NOTE: This is output-only for now.
- ADDED: Picasso96 speed-increase for modes greater than 256 colours.
- ADDED: More diagnostics for serious problems.
- ADDED: Settings in Misc panel of GUI for controlling WinUAE's behaviour when
         minimized.  User can now decrease the CPU usage of WinUAE when it is
         minimized.  User can now disable sound in WinUAE when it is minimized.
- CHANGED: Resolution selection under the Display panel in the GUI has changed
           so that the resolution drop-down list is available when you've got
           full-screen selected for Amiga screens, and is greyed-out when in
           windowed mode.
- CHANGED: Back to old-style DirectDraw support, which makes no use of the
           DirectDraw2 or DirectSurface2 COM interfaces.  Some users were
           complaining that all versions since WinUAE 0.8.6 R5 have failed on
           their machines.
- CHANGED: Even SMALLER executable now!
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.8 Release 1 - March 31, 1999
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Random crashes (WinUAE exits).
- FIXED: Rename problems in filesystem code.
- FIXED: Mounting illegal volume-names using the "automount" option.
- FIXED: Mounting the same volume-name twice.
- FIXED: Mounting of network-drives using the "automount" option.
- FIXED: Joystick/keyboard mappings no longer force the keypad into a joystick
         mode.
- FIXED: Hard-files of 2-Gig size will work.
- FIXED: Problem with Cyrix processors running VERY slowly in certain hardware
         configurations.
- FIXED: Huge bug with loading configuration files, relating to harddrive
         settings.
- FIXED: array-buffer glitch when using .dms and .adz files.
- FIXED: Now cleans up numerous memory and resource-leaks.  Windows is
         SUPPOSED to clean these up for a process which exits, but I don't
         want to rely on that.
- FIXED: CPU vs. Chipset slider under CPU Panel of GUI is available again
         while running.
- FIXED: Default resolution selection in the GUI is done now, so no "blank"
         resolution is selected.
- FIXED: ACTION_SET_DATE on directories will work
- FIXED: ACTION_SET_COMMENT with an empty comment will work.
- ADDED: LED/track-display in full-screen
- ADDED: Basic DiskChange support for READ-ONLY REMOVABLE drives - like CD-ROM
         drives.  If you have a PC CD-ROM drive mounted using the "Mount PC
		 Drives" option, and you change the CD, just issue a DiskChange
		 command at the shell-prompt, and the proper volume-name should then
		 appear.
- ADDED: Help button added to GUI.  Not functional yet.  But we're one step
         closer.
- ADDED: Mechanism for serious alerts to be displayed on-screen, rather than
         just in the log-file.
- ADDED: Preliminary support for writes to the VPOS register, so that games
         like B.C. Kid can program the chipset for 60Hz even when the custom-
         chips are set for PAL mode.
- ADDED: Chipset can be specified in GUI, including AGA
- ADDED: NTSC or PAL refresh-rate can be specified in the GUI.
- ADDED: Track-display of disk-drives in both windowed-mode and fullscreen.
- CHANGED: Configuration file-format has changed, but should still be able to
           read old configurations.  Blame this on Bernd!  8^)
- CHANGED: CPU-engine should be 5-10% faster now.
- CHANGED: Certain Picasso96 operations should be 5-10% faster now.
- CHANGED: Command-line parametes have changed as well.  Read the UNIX docs.
           To load a config-file, use 'winuae.exe -f configfile.uae'
		   To set an option, use 'winuae.exe -s option=parameter', such as
		   'winuae.exe -s use_gui=yes'
- CHANGED: log-file name is now winuaelog.txt instead of winuaelogs.txt
- CHANGED: Default bit-depth is 16-bit again, since AGA modes require that.
- CHANGED: Sound Panel is NOT available once running, since too many problems.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.6 Release 6 - December 19, 1998 - Merry Christmas Edition!
==============================================================================
- FIXED: 68020/68881 combination works again (finally).
- FIXED: Multiple joysticks are possible again.  Also improved GUI in this
         area, including an easy way to "swap" ports.
- FIXED: COM-ports higher than COM1 now work and can be saved.
- FIXED: Selecting a Picasso96 screen-mode that had the same dimensions and
         depth as the current screen would result in a non-functional
         P96-screen.
- FIXED: Mounted filesystems are faster for small-packet accesses, such as
         TAR or 'type'.  AddBuffers was missing when filesystems were
         mounted.
- FIXED: Palette changes on Windows Desktop (from utilities like Panorama)
         no longer corrupt the palette of an 8-bit (256 colour) full-screen
         Amiga.
- FIXED: Renaming files had a small bug, which caused "Put Away Icon" from
         Workbench to crash WinUAE.
- FIXED: Switching between full-screen and windowed Amiga screens now keeps
         the proper colour-depth.
- FIXED: Picasso screen-modes that matched the Windows Desktop dimensions
         would continue drawing even while WinUAE was minimized.
- FIXED: FPS area of status-bar can now accomodate large fonts.
- CHANGED: Single-click of a configuration no longer auto-loads it.  "Load"
           button added to Configurations panel of the GUI because of this
           change.
- CHANGED: UAEx: device-names renamed to DHx: for compatibility.
- CHANGED: "Windows" keyboard "Menu" key is now Right-Alt in Amiga, for all
           the German-keyboard users.
- CHANGED: WinUAE window-title is now simply "WinUAE".
- CHANGED: Display ModeID constants have changed, but should now be
           compatible across user installations.
- ADDED: Support for "no-DCI provider" graphics-cards.  Please let me know if
         this has solved any display-problems that some users may have had...
         NOTE: You will not achieve maximum speed of WinUAE without proper
         drivers for your video-card.  This new support is meant to allow all
         machines to run WinUAE, but not necessarily run it optimally.
- ADDED: Support for RTG/P96 Screens on your Windows Desktop.  Be warned,
         the performance of these screens are poor, and for maximum speed
         you should set your RTG Screen's number of colours to the same as
         your Windows Desktop.
- ADDED: New "Add PC Drives at Startup" option under Hard Drives panel in GUI.
  This option will automagically mount the available PC drive-letters for the
  Amiga to use, using the following naming convention:
  1. If the drive-letter has a Windows volume-name associated with it, the
     drive will get mounted in the Amiga using its volume-name.
  2. If no volume-name, the drive gets assigned an Amiga volume-name based on
     its drive-type:
         Hard Drives      --> WinDH_x:
         CD-ROM Drives    --> WinCD_x:
         Floppy Drives    --> WinDF_x:
         Network Drives   --> WinNW_x:
         Removable Drives --> WinRMV_x:
         RAM Disk Drives  --> WinRAM_x:
     where the 'x:' is the PC drive-letter.
  The beauty of this option is that the config-file can be used on ANY PC and
  the Amiga will automatically have access to all PC-drives valid on that PC.
  NOTE: If a drive doesn't currently have a disc in it (floppy, CD-ROM, etc.),
        then this option will NOT mount the drive for use by the Amiga.
- ADDED: Support for variable block-sizes in hardfiles.  Great for a .hdf
         generated by Amiga Explorer (part of Amiga Forever) which includes
         support for storage devices with block-sizes other than 512-bytes.
- ADDED: Right-click on a .uae config-file will now give "Open" and "Edit"
  choices.
- ADDED: API so the "Amiga" can minimize itself.
- ADDED: Log-file option in GUI and config-file.  Log-file is NOT generated by
         default.
- ADDED: Deleting a configuration prompts for confirmation.
- ADDED: Windowed-mode remembers its last position on-screen.
- CHANGED: This documentation has been updated slightly.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.6 Release 5 - October 27, 1998
==============================================================================
- Fixed the new ACTION_PARENT_FH DOS-packet, so that saving MUI and PPaint
  prefs works again.  This will hopefully make Fiasco work as well.
- Fixed networking support?
- Fixed 68020/68881 option in CPU-panel of GUI (now disabled since it isn't
  working right now).
- Added feature to use the refresh-rate of your Windows desktop as a cue for
  setting the DirectDraw full-screen frequency.
- Windowed Picasso96 is no longer available in GUI or config-files, because its
  not finished yet.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.6 Release 4 - October 22, 1998
==============================================================================
- The GUI is now functional!  Please report all bugs with it!  A single-click
  will load a configuration, with a double-click launching the configuration.
- Changed to be a true Windows Application again, meaning NO UGLY CONSOLE
  WINDOW when running WinUAE.exe from the Explorer, a Desktop shortcut, etc.
  All former console-output now goes to the winuaelogs.txt file in the same
  directory as the WinUAE executable.
- Changed configuration-file format and command-line parameters (ugh!).
  These should NOT change again.  Ever.  Never, ever!  Aaaaargh!
- Added mini-Installation program, which helps set up WinUAE, and maps the
  .uae extension of the new config-file format to directly run WinUAE.
- Removed the screen-swapping, monitor-popping, display-cycling at startup.
  This will only happen once after you've installed, and it will remember the
  setting for the future.
- The floppy-disk requester and kickstart ROM/Key-file requesters remember
  your favorite directory for .adf files and for .rom/.key files.
- Added waveout-looping sound support, from Mathias' "experimental" version.
- Added bsdsocket.library support (from Mathias as well).
- Added file-system code to allow ACTION_FH_FROM_LOCK, for ShowDVI/TeX.
- Added file-system code to allow ACTION_PARENT_FH, for Fiasco.
- Added drive-lights, power-LED, and FPS indicators when running in a window
  on the Windows Desktop.
- Fixed mounting of root-volumes.  If you cannot mount your root drive letter
  using X: then try using X:\ instead, or even X:\.. or X:\....
- Fixed the -w -1 and -w 0 options to work better.
- Fixed vertical-blanking interval to always be 50Hz, or as close as possible.
- Fixed serial-port support.  Same as in 0.7.5 releases.  Still no support for
  RTS/CTS on the Amiga-side.  With the bsdsocket.library implementation, you
  probably don't need the serial-port much.
- Fixed the '\' and '|' key.
- Fixed the numeric-keypad 'Enter' key to be different than the main 'Enter'.
- Fixed the left vs. right Ctrl and Alt keys.
- Fixed the ability to rename files/dirs to same name with different case:
  > rename tools Tools
  now works properly.  Please report any bugs with this.
- Included version 0.9 of uaegfx.card driver for P96.  This should go in
  your devs:Monitors/ drawer on the Amiga.  Newer P96 distributions should
  include this one, as well.  Fixes a couple of small bugs.
- Web page updated.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.6 Release 3 - August 25, 1998
==============================================================================
- Fixed random mounting of file-systems (-M or -m), due to uninitialized ptr.
- Fixed file-system code to handle illegal Windows file-names coming from the
  Amiga - they get mapped to/from valid names.  This allows MUI-3.8 to install
  with Installer 43.3 (tested).  Hopefully this fixes other Installer probs.
- Fixed file-system code to allow ACTION_SET_FILESIZE packet, for ShapeShifter
  usage (Create FileDisks now works).
- Sound now works in full-screen.
- Sound can be configured as either DirectSound or older waveOut-style.  See
  the help (-h) for WinUAE.  I recommend the following combination of sound
  and cpu-speed settings:  -w -1 -S 2:s:16:22050:1
- Fixed a slow-down bug in Picasso96 regarding blitting, where the blit was
  being done BOTH by native x86 code and by emulated 68k code.
- Fixed the A500 vs. Turbo parameter settings (-w) to match the Linux version.
  This means that "-w -1" gives full use of your x86 CPU, with "-w 0" only
  using enough x86 CPU power to emulate an A500.  These options only work
  right if sound is enabled (using at least -S 1).  On a PentiumII-266, and
  using -w 0 -S 2:s:16:22050:1 your CPU usage will hover around 50%, thus
  allowing your PC to still be useful while emulating the Amiga.
- Included version 0.9 of uaegfx.card driver for P96.  This should go in
  your devs:Monitors/ drawer on the Amiga.  Newer P96 distributions should
  include this one, as well.  Fixes a couple of small bugs.
- Fixed obscure bug with mounted CD-ROM drives and Audio CDs which caused a
  GURU.  The Audio CD will now show up on the Amiga as a list of files, but
  the Amiga will have no way to "play" the CD.
- Fixed .adz support.  Make sure gzip.exe is in your PATH somewhere.
- Fixed the help and this document regarding hard-file mounting.
- Web page updated.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.6 Release 2 - August 10, 1998
==============================================================================
- Finally fixed Picasso-screen refreshes when restoring minimized WinUAE!
- CD-ROM drives should be mountable using EITHER x: or x:\ or x:/, where x is
  the drive-letter of the CD-ROM drive.
- Fixed detection of 16-bit colour-modes, so that specifying a 16-bit Picasso
  mode shouldn't crap out your UAE-session.
- Fixed bug with -H option, such that specifying a "-H 2" to get 16-bit Amiga
  screens wouldn't work, and would drop you back to an 8-bit screen - even if
  your machine had a 15-bit mode available.
- Fixed -w options, and Cyrix users should be able to use this new version.
- Web page updated.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.8.6 Release 1 - August 8, 1998
==============================================================================
- Synchronized with Bernd's latest source-tree.
- GUI is missing (temporary).
- 68020/68881 CPU type is not working yet.
- 8-bit display is now the default.  Use -H option to specify other modes.
- New -O options for Amiga and/or Picasso displays in window or full-screen.
- New -w options for CPU speed settings.
- Web page updated (new Frequently Asked Questions section, donation count
  updated, Picasso96 1.40 link, new mirrors, etc.)
______________________________________________________________________________
0.7.5b Release 1 - May 23, 1998
==============================================================================
- Synchronized with Bernd's latest source-tree.  No significant changes which
  affect WinUAE.
- No longer have seperate archives for documentation, main program, etc.
- Include the necessary Amiga utilities in the archive: transdisk, transrom
- Default to 70Hz refresh-rate for full-screen display modes, not 75Hz.
- Eliminated the "Cyrix or 486 CPU" option in the Advanced panel of the GUI.
- Web page updated (new Frequently Asked Questions section, donation count
  updated, Picasso96 1.39 link, new mirrors, etc.)
______________________________________________________________________________
0.7.2 Release 2 - May 12, 1998
==============================================================================
- Fixed the freeze when running WinUAE in a window on your Win95 desktop.
- Fixed the CD-ROM mounting problems.
- Hard-files DO WORK - if you're having problems with an old one, try adjust-
  ing the parameters.
- Web page updated.
- Donations now accepted ($10 US) - see the web page for details.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.7.2 Release 1 - May 7, 1998
==============================================================================
- Ported in 0.7.2 changes (read the ChangeLog file) from Bernd.
  . Fixes BlitPattern() bug on Picasso96 screens
  . Fixes some bugs in the custom-chip emulation
- Hard-drive Files work.
- Added support in GUI for "slow" memory emulation (some games require this).
- Sound-code now based on WinUAE 0.6.9r12 (from Mathias Ortmann).  Thanks to
  Mathias for taking a break from school to help with this!
- Implemented DirectSound for fun.  Slightly slower than the standard sound
  handling code by Mathias, but should be more compatible?  This may help
  Gravis Ultra Sound users.
- Joystick settings can be changed while the emulation is running.
- Using F12 (or the "menu" key beside the right-Windows key) will bring up the
  GUI, and NOT crash/guru the "Amiga".
- 24-bit, 32-bit desktops are supported again.
- "Julian"-mode renamed, and saved with configurations.
- Added LED status to WinUAE when running in a window on your desktop.
- Now using assembly-code for planar-to-chunky conversion.  May be slower in
  some cases, depending on the machine.  Should generally be faster though.
- GUI problems cleaned up.
- Added new check for Cyrix (or other stupid CPU).  CYRIX USERS, PLEASE TRY
  DISABLING THE "Cyrix or 486 CPU" OPTION IN THE ADVANCED SETTINGS.  IF THIS
  WORKS, THE AUTO-DETECTION CODE IS GOOD, AND I CAN ELIMINATE THE "Cyrix" GUI
  SETTINGS, AND THE "-Q n" OPTION.
- Quitting WinUAE when running in a window would occasionally leave a piece
  behind in memory which kept further copies of WinUAE from running.
- WinUAE Home Page reworked yet again.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.7.0 Release 1 - March 23, 1998
==============================================================================
- Total rework of CPU-engine, thanks to Bernd Schmidt.  One single executable
  is now used for *all* versions of WinUAE - 68000, 68010, 68020, and 68020
  with 68881.
- Now completely a Win32 application.  Up-side: no more annoying console
  window appearing when you double-click on WinUAE.  Down-side: support for
  command-line interface is reduced.  Also, no visible logging.
  NOTE: I will most likely REMOVE the command-line support completely from
        WinUAE in the next version, since the GUI provides a complete
        interface to all of the commands.
- Reworked the GUI to accomodate up to sixteen hard-files and/or mount-points,
  as well as the new CPU settings.
- Sound now works in 8-bit and 16-bit formats.
- Scrolling bug in graphics has now been eliminated.
- Stretched GUI problem can be resolved - read the information on my web-page.
- Priority level of WinUAE is now NORMAL, rather than IDLE.  This should give
  a small performance boost when WinUAE is the foreground application.
- Directory-names with trailing slashes should be handled correctly now.
- New configuration-file format, but old files should still load correctly.
- New "Julian-Mode" option, so that middle-mouse-button can escape the mouse-
  capture which occurs when running WinUAE in windowed-mode.  No more having
  to press ALT-TAB just to lose the mouse-capture.  Just for you, Julian!
- Source-code will be available shortly both at my web-site, and also at the
  official UAE homepage.  Bernd is moving UAE to the GNU Public License.
- WinUAE Home Page reworked yet again.

0.7.0b2 Release 5 - March 10, 1998
==============================================================================
- Fixed problem with running WinUAE on your Windows desktop when the desktop
  was not 16-bit.  An 8-bit Windows desktop is still not really supported.

- Fixed the "No Logging" option to get rid of the Logging Console, when you
  run WinUAE from the Explorer or a desktop-shortcut.

- Fixed the mysterious "-w" glitch, where if you didn't specify it on the
  command-line, WinUAE would complain about an out-of-range value.

- Fixed the command-line parsing of "-P" and "-Q", so that if you don't give
  them an argument, you won't get an Access Violation anymore, but instead a
  warning that you're not using those parameters correctly.

- Fixed an obscure bug with the 68000-versions.  If your "default" configur-
  ation had any Graphics-Card memory specified, this would disable the
  "Full-Screen" option in the Display panel, and you'd be stuck always running
  in a window.  This didn't make sense, since the 68000-versions cannot *have*
  any Graphics-Card memory.

- Added more documentation to web-site.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.7.0b2 Release 4 - March 7, 1998
==============================================================================
- Fixed freezing problem.  No need to indicate a "Cyrix-CPU" when you don't
  have one.  This fix also makes the sound and mouse-movement somewhat
  smoother.

- Fixed volumes not being mounted by the GUI.  Ooops!

- Scrolling-bug still appears in scan-doubled modes (both windowed and full-
  screen), but speed is finally improved and fixed.  All display modes should
  be high-speed now, and sound should not break up when colour-cycling or
  fading occurs - on a suitably fast machine.

- Your "hardfile" is always mounted as 32:1:2, regardless of whether it has
  boot priority or not.  Previously, a hardfile with boot-priority would get
  mounted using 32:1:2, but if non-booting the hardfile was mounted with the
  32:1:0 settings.  A future WinUAE release will include control of these
  parameters in the GUI.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.7.0b2 Release 3 - March 7, 1998
==============================================================================
- Relative paths (..\shared\rom\kick.rom) should work now.  Additionally, if
  an incorrect or empty kickstart filename is given, WinUAE will look in the
  following order for "kick.rom":
    o In the current directory of WinUAE
    o In the location of "..\shared\rom\kick.rom", based from the current
      directory of WinUAE
  This philosophy also applies to the "rom.key" file for encyrpted Kickstarts.

- If WinUAE is started with no parameters, the GUI will show up, but any
  uae.rc file will be IGNORED.  This prevents confusion between the GUI and
  the uae.rc file.  If you wish to use the uae.rc file, you'll have to start
  WinUAE with a parameter (such as "-w 4" or something similar).

- Backed out some changes from Release 2, relating to graphics updates. Screen
  sizes should be back to normal, garbage should have dissappeared, and things
  should be as before.  There is a SMALL increase in speed as compared to
  Release 1, and an increase in compatibility as compared to Release 2.

- For optimal speed in a window (smooth graphics and sound), use the "Lo-Res"
  option, without the "Scan-Double" option.  The scrolling-bug does not appear
  with these settings.

- For larger size in a window, use the "Scan-Double" option, without the
  "Lo-Res" option.  This is smoother than in previous versions, but still not
  perfect.  The scrolling-bug will appear with these settings.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.7.0b2 Release 2 - March 5, 1998
==============================================================================
- Sound finally works at all quality settings and sampling rates, but only in
  16-bit audio.

- Screen refreshes when switching from Amiga to Picasso (and vice-a-versa)
  should work better.

- Major speed increase found for demos and games.  WinUAE 0.7.0b2, Release 2,
  should now run as fast or faster than the WinUAE 0.6.9 Release 13 beta 9,
  and be close to WinUAE 0.6.9 Release 12 (Mathias' version), DOS-UAE, etc.
  Don't thank me for this fix, but instead thank Mathias Ortmann!

- Yet another hard-file bug.  I stated that the GUI was passing options of
  32:1:2:hardfile to the emulator, but I was actually passing 32:1:0:hardfile.
  Therefore, if you could get your hardfile working in 0.7.0b2 Release 1 from
  the command-line with the -W 32:1:2:hardfile option, that same hardfile will
  *finally* work from the WinUAE GUI.
______________________________________________________________________________
0.7.0b2 Release 1 - February 27, 1998
==============================================================================
- Ported in 0.7.0b2 source.  Big deal.  Read my web-page for my views on this!

- Hard-files work again, as long as your existing hard-file is a power-of-two
  in megabytes (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 Megs, etc.).
  NOTE: This may be DANGEROUS!  Bernd has changed the hardfile interface in
        UAE, so you may toast your existing hardfile.  BACK IT UP FIRST, and
        use a backup copy to test.  If it DOES NOT WORK from the GUI, but
        does work from the cmd-line (using the new -W option), tell me the
        parameters you're passing!  I'm currently passing 32:1:2:hardfile, but
        if people can only get their existing hardfiles to work as 32:1:0 then
        I'll revert back to that in future WinUAE versions.

- Compiled with latest GCC 2.8.0 version, which supports Pentium and Pentium-
  Pro optimizations finally.  These versions are compiled with the -mpentium
  flag, as the -mpentiumpro flag seems to actually produce slower and larger
  executables?!?!

- Support for up to 64-Megs of Zorro-III "fast" memory.

- Fixed nasty bug in the "Startup" panel in the GUI.  It prevented proper
  awareness of various memory settings, which forced you to save and load a
  configuration in order to actually get a memory-setting to take effect.

- Added more logging options under the "Advanced" panel in the GUI.
______________________________________________________________________________
In Release 3 - February 25, 1998
==============================================================================
- Cyrix support is back in under the "Advanced" panel in the GUI, and can also
  be turned on from the cmd-line again using "-Q -1".

- FrameSync is working again, which keeps the clock in sync finally.  No high
  speed second hand in the analog Clock program anymore!

- Added Smart centering options, ala UAEL.  This is the equivalent of XY as
  opposed to xy in the video-options cmd-line flags.  These centering options
  only make sense when running games and demos, not Workbench.

- If "Log Debug Info" is turned on under the "Advanced" panel in the GUI, then
  the created console window gets closed by WinUAE, and all text output goes
  to "outfile".  If launching WinUAE from an existing console window, that
  window will remain.

- If a configuration named "default" exists in your Configurations directory,
  it will automatically be loaded when launching WinUAE.  Save your favorite
  "default" configuration, and from then on just double-click on WinUAE and
  then hit Enter (or click OK) to start the emulation.

- Archives contain proper versions of WinUAE this time.  Ooops!
______________________________________________________________________________
In Release 2 - February 24, 1998
==============================================================================
- IMPORTANT: Sound Blaster AWE 64 users - enable your "Full Duplex" option.

- Serial support works in both WinNT and Win95 again.  Win95 version doesn't
  hang or crash with serial-support.

- Exitting WinUAE should no longer hang your Win95 system.

- Tested with Picasso96 1.35.

- Doom Attack (Amiga Doom port) works, but colour cycling is abysmal.  Working
  on this, since Doom ports make a great testing environment for WinUAE and
  its Picasso96 support.

- Sound is corrupted unless you select level 3 sound compatibility, otherwise
  known as "Best Quality" in the GUI.  Working on this.

- Black rectangle on display is a DirectX bug with some drivers.  It does NOT
  appear on my system running DirectX-5 and a RIVA-128 AGP card under Win95.
______________________________________________________________________________
In Release 1 - November 9, 1997
==============================================================================
- IMPORTANT: Use Picasso96 1.31 now.  It is great, and includes the UAEGFX
  card drivers in its installation script.

- Picasso stuff mostly re-written for compatibility with the UN*X
  implementation that Bernd Schmidt has done.  Things seem to work better,
  but slightly slower again.  Watch for more updates.

- Support for Cloanto's "Amiga Forever" encrypted ROMs.

- Various GUI changes, some options removed to stay in sync with the UN*X
  version.

- 68000 versions (uae.exe and uaec.exe) now included.  uaec.exe is the
  more compatible of the two, but is approximately 20% slower.
____________________________________________________________________________
In Beta 9 - October 27, 1997
- IMPORTANT: Use Picasso96 1.29 rather than 1.30.  1.30 is broken.

- Blitting in >8-bit was broken in Beta 8

- Incorrect colours on some systems should now be fixed

- Advanced Page: "Slow Pixel Write" option no longer needed, the Picasso96
  DirectDraw system has been re-engineered

- Port Settings Page: Printer and Serial shouldn't be invisible while running
  UAE, just not selectable

- Rectangle filling should now work flawlessly

- Scroll-Lock again speeds up file-system accesses while in windowed mode

- Stretched dialog box and About button crashes can be fixed by installing
  Dial-Up Networking and/or Internet Explorer on the Win95 system
_____________________________________________________________________________
In Beta 8 - October 25, 1997
- Removed all resolution and display-mode restrictions.  24-bit modes are
  buggy and slower than 32-bit modes, so use them if you have problems.

- Some DirectDraw drivers are broken, and don't let a Picasso-screen open as
  8-bit (for example) if their Windows desktop resolution is greater than 8-
  bits per pixel.  This used to cause me to display garbage all over the
  desktop.  Now, I exit gracefully, with advice for the user to set their
  Windows desktop to 8-bit and try the problematic steps again.
  NOTE: This problem doesn't happen under WinNT, and is purely a result of
        broken DirectDraw drivers.  Get the latest drivers for your card, and
        contact them if the problem persists.  It happens on my AGP-based
        nVidia RIVA 128 card, and I'm not happy about it...

- InvertRect() function when using Picasso screens was broken, and always fell
  back to the 68020 code to do things, instead of using DirectX.

- CheckBoard (Picasso96 utility on Amiga side) now works when on an Amiga
  screen.

- Configurations Page: Description field would be associated with the wrong
  configuration entries.

- Port Settings Page: available again while the emulation is running, via the
  GUI. This allows you to change between joystick and mouse mode while running.

- About Page: Cloanto Copyright mentions are now removed.

- Display Settings Page: Width/Height of Amiga Window can now be custom-set in
  the GUI, and no longer restricted to *just* the DirectDraw display-modes
  available in the drop-down list.  This is ONLY AVAILABLE FOR WINDOW MODE...

- Advanced Page: Script-bit support removed, since it is too dangerous.

NOTES: Some users have reported that ClassAct doesn't like my Picasso stuff,
       or perhaps Picasso96 in general.  Removing "caprefs" from their startup
       sequence solved many problems.

       Additionally, I highly recommend using FastIPrefs instead of IPrefs. It
       makes alot of things faster and more stable.  Try it please.  I'm not
       including it in this archive, because I am unsure of its status.
______________________________________________________________________________
In Beta 7
- Fixed major bug in my new Picasso implementation regarding masks and blits.
  Things became REALLY slow when blitting things, because I was falling back
  to Picasso96-RTG functions on the Amiga-side in too many cases.  Now, as in
  BETA 4, more things are happening within UAE on Intel, rather than within
  the "Amiga" itself.

- Added .adz support to floppies requester.

- Put the monitor driver back in the archive.

In Beta 6
- Removed "Powered by Amiga" logo.  It belongs on the packaging, not the
  application.

- New UAEGFX.card library which goes in sys:Libs/Picasso96/ directory.

- GUI allows user to select resolution for Amiga ECS emulation, so that
  games can be opened in a 320x240 screen (for example).

- ZorroIII expansion support allows up to an additional 16-megs of RAM.
  No cmd-line option, though.

- FloppyDisk related ejection/insertion optimized.

- Can create blank-floppy disks using GUI while emulation is running.

- FloppyDisk settings page is the default page of the GUI once UAE is
  running.

- GUI has new "Advanced" settings page, which includes the adjustment
  for copper-settings (like the cmd-line option 'C'), a new "Slow Pixel
  Writes" option (see below), and a "Log Debug Information" option.

- Yet more file-system bugs fixed.  This seems to fix IPrefs and MUI related
  GURUs, and perhaps others.

- Fix for some people having cursor remnants getting blitted around.  This
  fix is with the new option "Slow Pixel Writes".  This option will not be
  necessary in the future, because I'll fix the REAL problem.  For now, it
  is a temporary work-around.

- Obey mask-values of drawing-operations while in Picasso96 screens.  This
  makes the Picasso96 modes slower, but more accurate.  I *may* add a new
  option to the new Advanced settings page that allows you to "Ignore Mask
  Setting", in order to recover some speed.  For now, however, accuracy is
  the default.
