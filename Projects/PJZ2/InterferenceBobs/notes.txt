Variant of a similar routine from "Blast from the Past". I assume it works in the same way as
the WinUAE visual DMA debugger shows a blitter fill occuring.

The way this works:

We have a single 64x64 BOB which is an unfilled circle. It's in blitter fill friendly format so
only 2 pixels per line. 

The BOBS and draw area are 1 bitplane.

The BOBS are drawn in a normal bob-snake way but using an XOR operation so that the same BOB
drawn in place will erase the first. This ensures that each line is left with an even number
of pixels so that a blitter fill will stay in bounds.

Then just blitter fill the entire screen and use previously drawn frames for additional
bitplanes/mirroring.
