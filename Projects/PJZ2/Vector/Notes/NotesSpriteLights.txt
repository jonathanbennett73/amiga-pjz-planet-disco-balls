Sprite lights

We use up to 4 sprites for 4 lights. Call them light 0,2,4,6 for parity with sprites.

We use spr0, 2, 4, and 6.

The lights are sorted into z-order with the nearest light at the front. The lights
are then assiged to spr0,2,4,6 in that order (spr0 is frontmost)

Determine where the vector object sits in relation to the 4 sprites and set bplcon2 in the copper

;bplcon2, pf2p2-0 are used when in single playfield mode
;000 PF   SPO1 SP23 SP45 SP67
;001 SP01 PF   SP23 SP45 SP67 
;010 SP01 SP23 PF   SP45 SP67 
;011 SP01 SP23 SP45 PF   SP67 
;100 SP01 SP23 SP45 SP67 PF 

This value for pf2p2-0 are the nnn values in this:
%0000|0000|00nn|n000

Valid values are
PF->SPR0->SPR2->SPR4->SPR6 = %0000|0000|0000|0000 = $0000
SPR0->PF->SPR2->SPR4->SPR6 = %0000|0000|0000|1000 = $0008
SPR0->SPR2->PF->SPR4->SPR6 = %0000|0000|0001|0000 = $0010
SPR0->SPR2->SPR4->PF->SPR6 = %0000|0000|0001|1000 = $0018
SPR0->SPR2->SPR4->SPR6->PF = %0000|0000|0010|0000 = $0020
