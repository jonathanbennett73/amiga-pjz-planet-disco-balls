Antiriad Notes, July 2019
=========================

Fonts to be drawn in any order. Tool can work out which letter is which because you pass it the letter order on cmd line.

Note: to use the character " put in the characters \'. For newline put in 
. For \ put in \\. To exclude dummy characters, use a space 

On a single row fonts to be touching each other, no extra spacing needed between. 
(unless you want to add it, for example if doing a 16x16 font may want want to include 1 pixel at the left or right). 
Rows can be spread out on the Y axis, tool has a "-gap" parameter to handle that.
No gridlines should be used (in Facet examples looks like he used a single pixel above the top left of each letter to form a grid)

Outputs
.BPL (bitmap)
.FAR (font ascii remap)
.BOB (structure containing details of each BOB)

.BPL
This is a standard bitplane sheet
How wide? Modulo?

.FAR (Font Ascii Remap)
A list of BYTES starting at ascii 0.
Unmapped characters (ascii chars that have no associated font bitmap) are $ff
To find details of letter "A" (ascii 65) read the byte at postition 65. This will be an 8 bit "BOB number" (the number shown in
preview .TGA file)
This number will be used to lookup details in the .BOB file

.BOB

A: dc.w	$0002, $002f, $001f, $000002f0, $0000, $0000
I: dc.w	$0001, $002f, $000d, $00001780, $0000, $0000

	RSRESET
BOBTABLE_WIDTHINWORDS:	rs.w	1	;Width of the BOB in words (see bob width notes below)
BOBTABLE_NUMSPRITES:	equ	Bob_WidthInWords
BOBTABLE_HEIGHT:	rs.w	1	;pixels
BOBTABLE_WIDTH:		rs.w	1	;pixels
BOBTABLE_OFFSET:	rs.l	1	;offset into BPL data
BOBTABLE_ANCHORX:	rs.w	1	;??
BOBTABLE_ANCHORY:	rs.w	1	;??
BOBTABLE_SIZEOF:	rs.b	0	;Just an assembler value to indicate size of structure

BOB width.
Note the converter always makes sure the font is a mutliple of 16 pixels (1 word) for blitting.
So an 19 pixel wide font would add an extra 13 pixels and BOBTABLE_WIDTHINWORDS=2

From the bob number (from FAR) you multiply by BOBTABLE_SIZEOF to find correct entry in BOB data.
	mulu	#BOBTABLE_SIZEOF,d0
	lea	FontBobTable,a2
	add.w	d0,a2
