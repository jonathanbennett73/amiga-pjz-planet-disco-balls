- Visual DMA debugger can be switched off, "vo".
- Added visual DMA debugger -5 and -6 modes (-5 = larger overlay with "transparency" and -6 = no "transparency)
- Added separate colors for visual DMA debugger copper wait and special cases (strobe extra cycle, 0xe0 cycle)
- Added visual DMA debugger configuration: DMA channels can be disabled and colors can be changed.
  "vm" = show status
  "vm <channel> <sub index>" = enable/disable toggle. (sub index is not used but must be included)
  "vm <channel> <sub index> <hex rgb>" = change color of channel. If sub index is zero: all sub index colors are changed.

Yes but you probably need to use console version (v vpos hpos) to see all details.
btw, remember to enable copper debugger first (od). Then check copper list (o-command), use it to find line you need DMA details, then use v-command to see exact details.
