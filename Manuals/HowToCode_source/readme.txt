HowToCode V7  - First AmigaGuide Edition.

I apologise in advance that this isn't as good as it should be, but
it was either release it like this or wait another month before I have
time to do any better.

There are a few problems:


1. Buttons going nowhere - I've not had time to fix all of these.. Sorry.

If you find any, please mail me.


2. Uses Multiview - I'm a 3.0 user. If you do not have multiview then the
easiest thing to do is to get an AmigaGuide viewer and copy it to your
sys:utilities/ drawer as multiview.


3. Mistakes - I've had very little time to fix mistakes. Most mistakes
reported to me were fixed. I'm sorry if there are some that weren't.


4. No instructions - If you can't work out how to install this, then
you won't find the contents very interesting :-)

Try an ASSIGN HOWTOCODE: <your directory> if you get stuck....


Having said all this, the AmigaGuide version is *FAR* more useable than
the original. I hope you enjoy it.

As always I look forward to your mail at:
