When you use sampling to produce a waveform, a side effect is caused when
the sampling rate &#034;beats&#034; or combines with the frequency you wish to
produce. This produces two additional frequencies, one at the sampling
rate plus the desired frequency and the other at the sampling rate minus
<a name="line6">the desired frequency. This phenomenon is called aliasing distortion.</a>

Aliasing distortion is eliminated when the sampling rate exceeds the
output frequency by at least 7 KHz. This puts the beat frequency outside
the range of the  <a href="../Hardware_Manual_guide/node00EE.html">low-pass filter</a> , cutting off the undesirable
frequencies. Figure 5-5 shows a frequency domain plot of the anti-aliasing
<a name="line12"> <a href="../Hardware_Manual_guide/node00EE.html">low-pass filter</a>  used in the system.</a>

Figure 5-6 shows that it is permissible to use a 12 KHz sampling rate to
produce a 4 KHz waveform. Both of the beat frequencies are outside the
range of the filter, as shown in these calculations:

                         12 + 4 = 16 KHz
<a name="line36">                         12 - 4 = 8 KHz</a>

          Figure 5-6: Noise-free Output (No Aliasing Distortion)


You can see in Figure 5-7 that is unacceptable to use a 10 KHz sampling
rate to produce a 4 KHz waveform. One of the beat frequencies (10 - 4) is
within the range of the filter, allowing some of that undesirable
<a name="line61">frequency to show up in the audio output.</a>

       desired output frequency


                   Figure 5-7: Some Aliasing Distortion


All of this gives rise to the following equation, showing that the
sampling frequency must exceed the output frequency by at least 7 KHz, so
that the beat frequency will be above the cutoff range of the
 <a href="../Hardware_Manual_guide/node00EE.html">anti-aliasing filter</a> :

   Minimum sampling rate = highest frequency component + 7 KHz

The frequency component of the equation is stated as &#034;highest frequency
component&#034; because you may be producing a complex waveform with multiple
frequency elements, rather than a pure sine wave.
