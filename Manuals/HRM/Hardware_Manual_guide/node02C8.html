The actual register assignments are below.  Most of the registers are the
same as for the Zorro II bus, and are included here for completeness.  The
Amiga OS software names for these registers in the ExpansionRom or
ExpansionControl structures are included.


Reg    ZII    ZIII    Bit
---    ---    ----    ---
00     02     100     7,6     These bits encode the PIC type:
--     (er_Type)
                                00      Reserved
                                01      Reserved
                                10      Zorro III
                                11      Zorro II

                      5       If this bit is set, the PIC's memory will
                              be linked into the system free pool.  The
                              Zorro III register 08 may modify the size
                              of the linked memory.

                      4       Setting this bit tells the OS to read an
                              autoboot ROM.

                      3       This bit is set to indicate that the next
                              board is related to this one; often
                              logically separate PICs are physically
                              located on the same card.

                      2-0     These bits indicate the configuration size
                              of the PIC.  This size can be modified for
                              the Zorro III cards by the size extension
                              bit, which is the new meaning of bit 5 in
                              register 08.

                                Bits    Unextended      Extended

04     06     104     7-0     The device's product number, which is
--     (er_Product)           completely up to the manufacturer. This is
                              generally unique between different
                              products, to help in identification of
                              system cards, and it must be unique between
                              devices using the automatic driver binding
                              features.

08     0A     108     7       This was originally an indicator to place
--     (er_Flags)             the card in the 8 megabyte Zorro II space,
                              when set, or anywhere it'll fit, if
                              cleared.  Under the Zorro III spec, this is
                              set to indicate that the board is basically
                              a memory device, cleared to indicate that
                              the board is basically an I/O device.

                      6       This bit is set to indicate that the board
                              can't be shut up by software, cleared to
                              indicate that the board can be shut up.

                      5       This is the size extension bit.  If
                              cleared, the size bits in register 00 mean
                              the same as under Zorro II, if set, the
                              size bits indicate a new size. The most
                              common new Zorro III sizes are the smaller
                              ones; all new sized cards get aligned on
                              their natural boundaries.

                      4       Reserved, must be 1 for all Zorro III cards.

                      3-0     These bits indicate a board's sub-size; the
                              amount of memory actually required by a
                              PIC.  For memory boards that auto-link,
                              this is the actual amount of memory that
                              will be linked into the system free memory
                              pool. A memory card, with memory starting
                              at the base address, can be automatically
                              sized by the Operating System.  This
                              sub-size option is intended to support
                              cards with variable setups without
                              requiring variable physical configuration
                              capability on such cards.  It also may
                              greatly simplify a Zorro III design, since
                              16-megabyte cards and up can be designed
                              with a single latch and comparator for base
                              address matching, while 8 megabyte and
                              smaller PICs require large latch/comparator
                              circuits not available in standard TTL
                              packages.

                              For boards that wish to be automatically
                              sized by the operating system, a few rules
                              apply.  The memory is sized in 512K
                              increments, and grows from the base address
                              upward.  Memory wraps are detected, but the
                              design must insure that its data bus
                              doesn't float when the sizing routine
                              addresses memory locations that aren't
                              physically present on the board; data bus
                              pullups or pulldowns are recommended.  This
                              feature is designed to allow boards to be
                              easily upgraded with additional or
                              increased density memoried without the need
                              for memory configuration jumpers.

                              is to allow  a manufacturer to uniquely
                              identify individual cards, but it can
                              certainly be used for revision information

                              the ROM code is located.  If the ROM
                              address valid bit is cleared, these
                              registers are ignored.

48     4A     148     7-0     Low order base address register, write only.
--     (ec_Z3_HighByte)       The high order register takes bits 31-24 of
       (ec_BaseAddress)       the board's configured address, the low
                              order register takes bits 23-16.  For Zorro
                              III boards configured in the Zorro II
                              space, the configuration address is written
                              both nybble and byte wide, with the
                              ordering:

                                Reg   Nybble     Byte
                                ---   ------     ----

                                48    A23-A20    A23-A16

                              Note that writing to register 48 actually
                              configures the board for both Zorro II and
                              Zorro III boards in the Zorro II
                              configuration block.  For Zorro III PICs in
                              the Zorro III configuration block, the
                              action is slightly different. The software
                              will actually write the configuration as
                              byte and word wide accesses:

                                Reg   Byte       Word
                                ---   ----       ----

                                44    A31-A24    A31-A16

                              The actual configuration takes place when
                              register 44 is written, thus supporting any
                              physical size of configuration register.

4C     4E     14C     7-0     Shut up register, write only.  Anything
--     (ec_Shutup)            written to 4C will cause a board that
                              supports shut-up to completely disappear
                              until the next reset.

 *  The original Zorro specifications called for a few registers, like
    these, that remained active after configuration.  Support for this is
    impossible, since the configuration registers generally disappear
    when a board is configured, and absolutely must move out of the
    $00E8xxxx space.  So since these couldn't really be implemented in
    hardware, system software has never supported them.  They're included
    here for historical purposes.
