For more complex or larger moving objects, you can overlap sprites.
Overlapping simply means that the sprites have the same or relatively
close screen positions. A relatively close screen position can result in
<a name="line5">an object that is wider than 16 pixels.</a>

The built-in  <a href="../Hardware_Manual_guide/node00C3.html">sprite video priority</a>  ensures that one sprite appears to be
behind the other when sprites are overlapped. The priority circuitry gives
the lowest-numbered sprite the highest priority and the highest numbered
sprite the lowest priority. Therefore, when designing displays with
overlapped sprites, make sure the &#034;foreground&#034; sprite has a lower number
than the &#034;background&#034; sprite. In Figure 4-11, for example, the cage should
be generated by a lower-numbered sprite  <a href="../Hardware_Manual_guide/node00BF.html">DMA channel</a>  than the monkey.

     <a href="../Hardware_Manual_guide/node02D5.html">Figure 4-11: Overlapping Sprites (Not Attached)</a> 

You can create a wider sprite display by placing two sprites next to each
other. For instance, Figure 4-12 shows the spaceship sprite and how it can
<a name="line19">be made twice as large by using two sprites placed next to each other.</a>
