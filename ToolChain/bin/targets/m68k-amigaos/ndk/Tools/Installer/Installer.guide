   Installation of applications from floppy disks onto a hard disk has
proven to be a very inconsistent and often frustrating endeavor for most
end-users.  This has been caused by many factors, some of which are:

  a. Many products do not come with any utility or script to install an
     application on a hard disk.

  b. Many products assume a great deal of familiarity with the startup
     process of the Amiga and applications, including assigns, device
     names (as opposed to volume names), etc.

  c. The installation scripts or utilities included with some products
     vary widely in their ability to deal with different environments
     and systems.


   In 1991, Commodore set out to remedy this situation, by developing a
standard tool that developers can include with their products, which
provides the user with a standard way to install applications.  The
Installer's features were based on a number of assumptions:

  a. Installation requirements vary widely--some need assigns, some need
     new drawers created, some install pieces in system drawers such as
     a fonts drawer, a `product' might be just an upgrade and the
     installation must check to see which version (if any) they
     currently have installed, etc.

  b. Different users have different levels of comfort and expertise when
     attempting to install software, and the Installer should be able to
     accommodate a range of users.  Many installation scripts assume a
     great deal of knowledge, which is very intimidating for a novice.

  c. The Installer tool must be very flexible internally, but present a
     consistent pleasant graphical user interface to the user that only
     shows the user information or prompts that they need to see.  The
     Installer should be resolution, color and font sensitive.

  d. Writing scripts to install an application will require some effort,
     but certainly no more than writing an AmigaDOS shell script
     equivalent, and the resulting installation procedure will be more
     friendly, flexible, and much better looking than the latter.


   Amiga Technologies improves the Installer to allow even better and
more versatile Installation procedures while keeping it fairly general.
Many new features have been added during V43 Installer development.

   Amiga Inc. improves the Installer to allow graphical effects and
multimedia displays under Installer control. Additionally a backtrace
mechanism is implemented.

@{B}Overview
********@{UB}

   The Installer is a script driven program, that presents a consistent
installation environment to the end user.  The user never sees the
script.  Instead they are presented with simple yes/no choices, and may
be asked to specify locations to put things on their system.

   To accommodate different user levels, they can choose to run the
tool in novice, average or expert modes.  Scripts can include help text
to explain any choices that the user must make.  At each step the user
is given the option of aborting the installation.

@{B}Standard Invocation
===================@{UB}

   The Installer is normally started from a Workbench Project icon
which has the same name as the script to interpret and has a default
tool of Installer.  A number of tooltypes are available to modify the
operation of the Installer:

`SCRIPT'
     Path to a script file to be used with Installer.

`APPNAME'
     Name of the application being installed (appears in the startup
     screen).  This MUST be given.

`MINUSER'
     The minimum possible operation mode of the installation for a
     script.  This will be either NOVICE (all decisions made by
     Installer), AVERAGE (only important decisions made by user) or
     EXPERT (user confirms almost all actions).  The Default is NOVICE.

`DEFUSER'
     Indicates which operation mode button should be initially
     selected.  Same values as MINUSER, with the value of the MINUSER
     tooltype being the default (which will be NOVICE if MINUSER not
     defined).

`NOPRINT'
     If set to FALSE, then the printer option in the log file settings
     will be ghosted.

`PRETEND'
     If set to FALSE, indicates that PRETEND mode not available for
     this script.

`LANGUAGE'
     Used to set the variable `@language'.  The default value for
     `@language' is the name of the current locale or `"english"' if
     there isn't any available.  The use of this variable is left up to
     the install script and should be used to adapt the language for
     the script's messages to the chosen information.  Note that with
     Installer V42 and better, the current locale as set by the OS will
     automatically be used if no language has been specified.  This
     tooltype should probably only be used to force a certain language
     while testing a script or when a system with OS 2.04 is expected
     to be the target.  For the latter, it is recommended that you use
     the `getversion' command to check the OS version.

`LOGFILE'
     The name of the log file that the Installer should use.  This must
     be a full path.  The default is `install_log_file'.

`LOG'
     In NOVICE mode the default is to create a log file (to disk).  If
     this tooltype is set to FALSE, the creation of a log file in
     NOVICE mode is disabled.

   Although the Installer can be started from the Shell, that is not the
recommended mode.  Shell invocation is provided mainly for script
debugging purposes.  The command template is:

   `SCRIPT,APPNAME,MINUSER,DEFUSER,LOGFILE,LANGUAGE,NOPRETEND/S,
NOLOG/S,NOPRINT/S'

   The first thing the Installer does is to compile the installation
script into an internal format that can be easily interpreted.  If
there are syntax errors in the script, they will be caught during this
phase.

@Node "Startup Screens" "installer.guide/Startup Screens"

@Next "Installation Actions"

@{B}Startup Screens
===============@{UB}

   Next, the Installer asks the user what Installation Mode to run in,
either NOVICE, AVERAGE or EXPERT.  If the user chooses NOVICE, they
will not be asked any more questions (although they may be requested to
do things).  In the other user levels, a second display appears asking
the user if he wants to install "for real" or "do a dry run", and if he
wants a transcription of the installation process written, and if so,
whether to a file or to the printer. In EXPERT mode, the user should be
asked for every configuration option like installation drawers, while
only the most important questions will be asked in AVERAGE mode.

   Now the Installer interprets its internal version of the script.  Any
commands that call for a user interface will cause the Installer to
algorithmically generate a display, always including buttons to allow
for context sensitive help and aborting the installation.

@{B}Style Guide
***********@{UB}

   Making an installation script for any typical application is fairly
easy with Installer 44.10.  But to make a really great installation,
please adhere to the rules outlined below:

     Installer V43 provides some new features over older versions like
     better return values for certain statements or optional
     proportional rendering for choices. The minimum version necessary
     is marked in the respective descriptions.  @{B}Please check the
     variable `@installer-version' before using these new features@{UB}.
     This variable will default to 0 with old versions of Installer
     like V1.24, so it is safe and easy to check.  Please do not do an
     exact equality check. Check for a minimum revision, just like with
     libraries.

     Starting with V42 there are some reasonable guidelines for naming
     things. Please adhere to them or upgrading Installer will be very
     hard. Don't use the `@' sign for your variables. This sign marks
     installer system variables. Please @{B}do@{UB} use a prefix for your
     variable names like `#' and name your procedures carefully by
     using a prefix like `P_'. Names without a prefix may collide with
     future enhancements to Installer.

     Always, always, always set up meaningful help texts within your
     install script.

     Don't install parts of your application into the standard OS
     drawers like `DEVS:', `SYS:', or `FONTS:' unless absolutely
     necessary.  Many people try to keep their OS installation and
     applications separate for easier updates. Never forget that
     `PROGDIR:' might be what you really want.

     If you can't keep needed files together, at least leave a way to
     change the destination to something other than e.g.  `LIBS:'.

     Always, always, always allow for a deinstallation in your script.
     This is another reason to avoid spreading files around too much.

     If you are installing or deinstalling libraries, take care that you
     don't simply overwrite an existing library or delete it when some
     other program might have a need for it.  If in doubt ask the USER,
     @{B}if@{UB} she is not a NOVICE.

     Don't keep the user waiting if it is not necessary.  If your
     application fits on one disk, ask all necessary questions @{B}first@{UB},
     and install the files afterwards.

     If you have to ask the user for an application directory, make
     very clear if your script will create the application directory
     there or if the user has to create and specify the directory
     himself.  This has been the source of much confusion in many
     scripts.

     Don't ask any questions in NOVICE mode. If you absolutely have to
     ask questions, don't support NOVICE mode. Any NOVICE mode
     installation should be capable of running successfully without user
     interaction.

     Make a difference between AVERAGE and EXPERT mode. In EXPERT mode
     the user should be able to confirm just about everything. In
     AVERAGE mode, only very important questions should be asked. Do not
     let AVERAGE and EXPERT be equal. Give the expert user somethig to
     work with and don't confuse the average user.

     Starting with V44 the Installer allows backtracing in your script.
     If you use this mechanism the "Abort Install" button is replaced
     with a "Back" button in most cases. You should define a (back)
     parameter for all statements and functions with user interaction
     that presents the "Back" button. If you don't the "Back" button is
     disabled which may frustrate the user.

@{B}NOTE:@{UB} Depending on the AmigaGuide or MultiView version you are using,

   A symbol is any sequence of characters surrounded by spaces that is

that symbols can have punctuation marks and other special characters in
them.  The following are all valid symbols:

     `x'

     `total'

     `this-is-a-symbol'

     `**name**'

     `@#__#@'

   When naming variables, you should not use `@' as prefix for your

future Installer enhancements.

@{B}Types of Symbols
================@{UB}

There are three types of symbols:

  a. user-defined symbols.  These are created using the `set' function.

  b. built-in function names.  These include things like `+' and `*' as
     well as textual names such as `delete' or `rename'.

  c. special symbols.  These are variables which are created by the
     Installer before the script actually starts to run, and are used
     to tell the script certain things about the environment.  These
     symbols always begin with an `@' sign.  An example is
     `@default-dest' which tells you the default directory that was
     selected by the Installer.

@EndNode


@Node "Statements" "installer.guide/Statements"

@Next "Data Types"
@Prev "Types of Symbols"
@Toc "Scripting Language Tutorial"

@{B}Statements
==========@{UB}

The format of a statement is:

     (operator <operand1> <operand2> ...)

A statement to assign the value `5' to the variable `#x' would be:

     (set #x 5)

   You can read this as "set `#x' to 5".  Note that the variable `#x'
does not have to be declared - it is created by this statement.

   Note that there is no difference between operators and functions -
the function @{"`set'" Link "s_set"}, and the arithmetic operator `+' are both used
exactly the same way.

   Combining statements:  A statement can be used as the operand to
another statement as follows:

     (set #var (+ 3 5))

   In this case, the statement `(+ 3 5)' is evaluated first, and the
result is 8.  You can think of this as having the `(+ 3 5)' part being
replaced by an 8.  So now we are left with:

     (set #var 8)

which is the same form as the first example.

   Note that the `(+ 3 5)' part actually produced a value:  8.  This is
called the @{B}result@{UB} of the statement.  Many statements return results,
even some that might surprise you, such as `set' and `if'.


@EndNode


@Node "Data Types" "installer.guide/Data Types"

@Next "Special Features"
@Prev "Statements"
@Toc "Scripting Language Tutorial"

@{B}Data Types
==========@{UB}

   All data types in the Installer are dynamic, that is to say the type
of a variable is determined by the data it contains.  So if you assign
the string `"Hello, World"' to the variable `#x', then `#x' will be of
type STRING.  Later you can assign an integer to `#x' and `#x' will be
of type INTEGER.  When using variables in expressions, the interpreter
will attempt to convert to the proper type if possible.

   Special forms:  There are two exceptions to the form of a statement.
The first type is used for string substitution:  If the first item in
parentheses is a text string rather than a function name, the result of
that clause is another string that is created by taking the original
string and performing a C-style `sprintf'-like formatting operation on
it, using the other arguments of the statement as parameters to the
formatting operation.

Thus the statement:

     ("My name is %s and I am %ld years old" "Mary" 5)

Becomes:

     "My name is Mary and I am 5 years old"

@{B}NOTE:@{UB} since the formatting operation uses the ROM `RawDoFmt()' routine,
decimal values must always be specified with `"%ld"' rather than `"%d"'
(The interpreter always passes numeric quantities as 32 bit longwords).
Note that a variable containing a string may be used rather than the
string itself.

   The second type of exception occurs if the elements in parentheses
are themselves statements in parentheses.  In this case, the interpreter
assumes that all the elements are statements to be executed
sequentially.

   For example, this statement sets the value of three different
variables: `#var1', `#var2', and `#var3'.

     ((set #var1 5) (set #var2 6) (set #var3 7))

   What this feature does is allow the language to have a block
structure, where an `if' statement can have multiple statements in its
`then' or `else' clause.  Note that the result of this statement will
be the result of the last statement in the sequence.

   Complex statements:  Here is an example of how statements in the
script language can be combined into complex expressions.  We will
start with an `if' statement.  The basic format of an `if' statement is:

     (if <condition> <then-statement> [<else-statement>])

   The condition should be a statement which returns a value.  The
`then' and optional `else' parts should be statements.  Note that if the
`then' or `else' statements produce a result, then the `if' statement
will also have this result.

   Our first example is a rather strange one:  Using an `if' statement
to simulate a boolean `not' operator.  Note that there are actually
easier ways in the script language to do this.

     (set #flag 0)               ; set a flag to FALSE
     
     (set #flag (if #flag 0 1))  ; a Boolean NOT

   Basically, the `if' statement tests the variable `flag'.  If flag is
non-zero, it produces the value `0'.  Otherwise, the result is `1'.  In
either case, `flag' is set to the result of the `if' statement.

   Now, let's plug some real statements into our `if' statement.

     (if #flag                               ; conditional test
         (message "'flag' was non-zero\\n")   ; "then" clause.
         (message "'flag' was zero\\n")       ; "else" clause.
     ) ; if                                  ; closing parenthesis

   Note the style of the indenting.  This makes for an easier to read
program.  The preferred indent is four spaces.

   Now, we'll add a real condition.  `=' tests for equality of the two
items.

     (if (= #a 2)                   ; conditional test
         (message "a is 2\\n")       ; "then" clause
         (message "a is not 2\\n")   ; "else" clause
     ) ; if                         ; closing parenthesis

   Finally, just to make things interesting, we'll make the `else'
clause a compound statement. Note the extended use of parentheses to
generate exactly the two needed clauses. Installer won't check things
if you mess up here!

     (if (= #a 2)                          ; conditional test
       (                                   ; "then" clause
         (message "a is 2\\n")
       )
       (                                   ; "else" compound statement
         (message "a is not 2\\n")
         (set #a 2)
         (message "but it is now!\\n")
       )                                   ; end of compound statement
     ) ; if                                ; end of if

@{B}Special Features
================@{UB}

   When the Installer starts running, it attempts to determine the best
place to install the application.  Any volume named `WORK:' is given
preference, as this is the standard way that an Amiga comes configured
from Amiga Technologies. Starting with V42 the largest writable
partition available will also be under consideration as default
destination. This covers the typical cases.

   There are two keyboard shortcuts.  Whenever there is a `Help' button
active, pressing the HELP key will also bring up the help display.
Whenever there is an `Abort' button active, pressing ESC brings up the
abort requester.  Also, whenever the Installer is @{B}busy@{UB}, pressing ESC
brings up the abort requester - there is text is the title bar to that
effect.

   If an application must have assigns or other actions performed during
system boot, the Installer will add these to a file named
`S/User-Startup' on the boot volume. If this file isn't available,
`S:User-Startup' will be tried. The Installer will then add the lines

     if exists S:user-startup
     execute S:user-startup
     endif

   to the user's `Startup-Sequence'.  The Installer will attempt to
determine the true boot volume of the system when looking for the
`Startup-Sequence' and `User-Startup'. It can handle any AmigaDOS
scripts executed from `Startup-Sequence' up to 10 levels of nesting.

   The Installer can create an assign to just a device, volume or
logical assignment.  This comes in handy when you want to update an
application which comes on a volume named `MyApp:', but the installed
version is in a directory with the logical assign `MyApp:'!

   The Installer always copies files in the AmigaDOS `CLONE' mode,
meaning all the protection bits, filenotes and file dates are
preserved.  When copying files the Installer gives a "fuelgauge"
readout of the progress of the copy.

   The Installer can find the version number of any executable file
that has either a RomTag with an ID string (such as libraries and
devices) or has a version string conforming to that given in the Amiga
User Interface Style Guide. The Installer can also checksum files.

@{B}Miscellaneous
=============@{UB}

   To perform a set of actions on all the contents of a directory
matching a pattern you can use the `foreach' operator.  To perform a
set of actions on an explicit set of files, the following Installer
statements can be used as a template:

     (set #n 0)
     (while (set thisfile (select #n "file1" "file2" "file3" ""))
       (
         (set #n (+ #n 1))
         (... your stuff involving this file ...)
       )
     ) ; while

   Note that an empty string is considered a FALSE value to any
condition operator.

   To run an external Shell command which normally requires user input,
redirect the input from a file with the needed responses.  For example,
to format a disk one could combine the statement shown below with a
file which contains only a newline character.

     (run "format <nl_file drive DF0: name ToBeEmpty")

@{B}Very Important Notes
====================@{UB}

  a. `diskimage' is a reserved name (V42). Don't try to use this name.
     Please read on!

  b. Starting with V42 there are some reasonable guidelines for naming
     things. Please adhere to them or upgrading Installer will be very
     hard. Don't use the `@' sign for your variables. This sign marks
     installer system variables. Please @{B}do@{UB} use a prefix for your
     variable names like `#' and name your procedures carefully by
     using a prefix like `P_'. Names without a prefix may collide with
     future enhancements to Installer.

  c. Remember that Installer doesn't support local variables.

  d. When the script exits either by comming to the end or via the
     `exit' statement, a message will be displayed saying where the
     application was installed and where the logfile (if any) was
     written.  Note that you must store in `@default-dest' where you
     actually installed the application (see `@default-dest' below).

  e. A newline character (\\\\n, `0x0a') will cause a line break when
     the Installer performs word-wrapping.  A hard-space (ALT-space,
     `0xa0') will prevent a word break when the Installer performs
     word-wrapping.  Also, quoted sections will be considered one word
     for word-wrapping purposes.  For example, if the following help
     text was used:

          "The disk name \\"FrameZapper 2.0\\" is needed to complete installation."

     then the text "FrameZapper 2.0" will not have a word break before
     the "2".

  f. The maximum size of a string in a script is 512 bytes.  The maximum
     size of any string variable is 10000 bytes.  If you need to create
     long help text for example, break it into 512 byte chunks and then
     use the automatic string concatenation ability of the Installer to
     create the final, larger string.  Also, don't overlook the use of
     line continuation of strings in scripts to make your scripts more
     manageable.  If you ever find that the Installer reports a stack
     overflow error, look to see if it was caused by too many small
     strings being concatenated and merge them into larger blocks.

  g. File name and directory name wildcard patterns specified in a
     script must not be longer than 64 characters.

@{B}The `set' statement
-------------------@{UB}

     (set <varname> <value> [<varname2> <value2> ...])

   Set the variable `<varname>' to the indicated value.  If `<varname>'
does not exist it will be created.  Set returns the value of the last
assignment.

@{B}NOTE:@{UB} All variables are typeless, and any variable may be used wherever
a string could be used.  All variables are global. For naming
conventions, please check the @{"Style Guide" Link "Style Guide"}.

   The `set' statement can be used to convert a string to an integer
value:

     (set <integer-var> (+ <string-var>))

   To do the reverse, use @{"`cat'" Link "f_cat"}.

   Set the variable that is named by the contents of the string
variable or expression `<symbolname>' to the indicated value.  If the
variable that `<symbolname>' names does not exist, it will be created.
The statement `symbolset' returns the value of the last assignment.

   Together with the function @{"`symbolval'" Link "f_symbolval"}, this function is intended to
allow somewhat dynamic handling of variable names, e.g. to create
variables with an arbitrary index in the name.

statement will try to create the complete path with all specified
intermediate directories. Parameters:

`prompt'
     tell the user what's going to happen.

`help'
     text of help message

`infos'
     create an icon for directory

`confirm'
     if this option is present, the user will be prompted, else the

@{B}The `copyfiles' statement
-------------------------@{UB}

     (copyfiles <parameters>)

   Copies one or more files from the install disk to a target
directory.  Each file will be displayed with a checkmark next to the
name indicating if the file should be copied or not.  Note that a write
protected file is considered "delete protected" as well.  Parameters:

`prompt'
`help'
     tell the user what's going to happen.

`source'
     name of source directory or file.

`dest'
     name of destination directory, which is created if it doesn't
     exist.  Note that both source and dest may be relative pathnames.

`newname'
     if copying one file only, and file is to be renamed, this is the
     new name.

`choices'
     a list of files/directories to be copied (optional)

`all'
     all files/directories in the source directory should be copied.

`pattern'
     indicates that files/directories from the source dir matching a
     pattern should be copied.  The pattern should be no more than 64
     characters long.  Note that only one of `choices', `all' or
     `pattern' should be used at any one time.

`files'
     only copy files.  By default the Installer will match and copy
     subdirectories.

`infos'
     switch to copy icons along with other files/directories.

`noposition'
     reset the position of every icon copied.

`fonts'
     switch to not display `.font' files, yet still copy any that match
     a directory that is being copied.

`nogauge'
     don't display the status indicator.

`(optional <option> <option> ...)'
     dictates what will be considered a failure on copying.  The first
     three options are mutually exclusive (they may not be specified
     together).

    `fail'
          Installer aborts if could not copy (the default).

    `nofail'
          Installer continues if could not copy.

    `oknodelete'
          aborts if can't copy, unless reason was "delete protected".

     The next two options may be used with any other `optional' options.

    `force'
          unprotect destination

    `askuser'
          ask user if the file should be unprotected (but not in
          novice) In the case of `askuser', the default for novice mode
          is an answer of "no".  Therefore, you may want to use `force'
          to make the novice mode default answer appear to be "yes".

`(delopts <option> <option> ...)'
     removes options set by `optional'

`confirm'
     if this option is present, user will be prompted to indicate which
     files are to be copied, else the files will be copied silently.

`safe'
     copy files even if in PRETEND mode.

`compression'
     if this flag is set, all the source files must have been
     compressed with the Un*x `compress' LZW algorithm, version 3.0 or
     better.  The files will automatically be uncompressed while
     copying them to the destination.  Note that compression with more
     than 13 bits takes up a really significant amount of memory when
     uncompressing a file.  The maximum number of bits supported is 16.
     This needs close to 500KB of memory while uncompressing!  Make a
     wise choice for the maximum amount of bits when compressing a file
     or the uncompression might fail due to lack of memory!

@{B}     WARNING: The compression implementation is still highly
     experimental and in alpha stadium. You may play with it and submit
     bug reports. DO NOT USE THIS FOR PRODUCTION CODE!@{UB}

@{B}The `copylib' statement
-----------------------@{UB}

     (copylib <parameters>)

   Copies one file using version checking; i.e., it only overwrites an
existing file if the new file has a higher version/revision number.  The
`copylib' statement will create the destination directory as long as
there is only one level missing.  For example, copying to a non-existent
`DEVS:midi' would create the directory `midi', but copying to
`DEVS:midi/extra' where neither `midi' nor `extra' exists would fail.
Note that a write protected library file is considered "delete
protected" as well.  Parameters:

`prompt'
`help'
     tell the user what's going to happen.

`confirm'
     if this option is present, user will be prompted to confirm the
     copy operation, else the files will be copied silently.  Note that
     an EXPERT user will be able to overwrite a newer file with an
     older one.

`safe'
     copy the file even if in PRETEND mode.

`source'
     name of source file.

`dest'
     name of destination directory, which is created if it doesn't
     exist.  Note that both source and dest may be relative pathnames.

`newname'
     if the file is to be renamed, this is the new name.

`infos'
     switch to copy the icon along.

`noposition'
     reset the position of every icon copied.

`nogauge'
     don't display the status indicator.

`(optional <option> <option> ...)'
     dictates what will be considered a failure on copying.  The first
     three options are mutually exclusive (they may not be specified
     together).

    `fail'
          Installer aborts if could not copy (the default).

    `nofail'
          Installer continues if could not copy.

    `oknodelete'
          aborts if can't copy, unless reason was "delete protected"

     The next two options may be used with any other `optional' options.

    `force'
          unprotect destination

    `askuser'
          ask user if the file should be unprotected (but not in
          novice) In the case of `askuser', the default for novice mode
          is an answer of "no".  Therefore, you may want to use `force'
          to make the novice mode default answer appear to be "yes".

@Toc "Statements (Ref)"

@{B}The `startup' statement
-----------------------@{UB}

     (startup <appname> <parameters>)

   This command edits the `S:User-Startup' file, which is executed by
the user's `Startup-Sequence' (Installer will modify the user's
`Startup-Sequence' if needed, although in a friendly way).  The
`command' parameter is used to declare AmigaDOS command lines which
will be executed.  The command lines are grouped by application, using
the supplied argument `appname'.  If there is already an entry in
`S:User-Startup' for that application, the new command lines will
completely replace the old.  The command lines for other applications
will not be affected.  Note:  The prompt and help parameters for the
`startup' statement are only used by the confirmation display to edit
`User-Startup'.  This only happens in NORMAL or EXPERT mode, or in
NOVICE mode if the `confirm' parameter is included.  Parameters:

`prompt'
`help'
     tell the user what's going to happen.

`confirm'
     if this option is present, user will be prompted to confirm the
     operation, otherwise the modification proceeds silently.

`command'
     used to declare an AmigaDOS command line to be executed at system
     startup.

   Note that Installer will try to locate the User-Startup file on the
boot volume in the script directory. Only if this is not available, the
assign `S:' will be used.

@{B}The `tooltype' statement
------------------------@{UB}

     (tooltype <parameters>)

   Modify an icon's tool type and more.  Normally the new tool type
values will be set up in advance by various statements in the install
language (i.e.  the user does not actually have to type in the tooltype
values).  For example, you could use an `askchoice' to ask the user
what type of screen resolution they want and then format the tooltype
string based on their choice. The `tooltype' operation merely asks for a
confirmation before actually writing.

   Note that the `settooltype' parameter has either one or two
arguments, in the general form `(settooltype "tooltype")' or
`(settooltype "tooltype" "toolvalue")'.  The first form is used to
delete a tooltype from an icon.  The second form will set a new value
for a new or existing tooltype.  The tooltype name will always be
forced to uppercase.  Parameters:

`prompt'
`help'
     tell the user what's going to happen.

`dest'
     the name of the icon to be modified. There is no need to specify a
     `.info' extension.

`settooltype'
     the tooltype name and value string

`setdefaulttool'
     default tool name for a project

`setstack'
     set size of stack

`noposition'
     reset icon position to NOICONPOSITION. Be careful, don't
     arbitrarily mess with the user's icon positions on updates!

`setposition (V42.12)'
     Two integer values giving the new icon position in X and Y
     direction. @{B}Do not use this lightly@{UB}. It is intended to keep icon
     positions on updates with help of the new function @{"`iconinfo'" Link "f_iconinfo"}.
     Arbitrarily changing icon positions will lead to annoyed users due
     to different Workbench and font setups.

`swapcolors'
@{B}     OBSOLETE! DO NOT USE THIS!@{UB}

`confirm'
     if this option is present, the user will be asked for confirmation,
     otherwise the modification proceeds silently.

     (protect <file> [<string of flags to change>] [<decimal mask>] <parameters>)

   Either gets the protection status of a file (if a second argument is
not given), or sets it.  Two methods exist for setting the status:
string (e.g.  `"+rgr -wgw +e -dgd"') or numeric (e.g.  5).  The string
method allows the changing of any of the flags individually, while
numeric writes to all flags at once (possibly changing bits
unintendedly).  The bits in the binary representation of the decimal
mask correspond to the flags in the following manner:

     8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  <- Bit number
     
     h s p a r w e d  <- corresponding protection flag

   Note that the meaning of the bits in the numeric value follows the
DOS convention that a 1 in the high four bits (flags "hspa") indicates
that the flag is set, while a 1 in the lower four bits (flags "rwed")
indicates that the flag is cleared.  You can use the `"g"' and `"o"'
modifiers to set group and other flags.  They are valid for all the
immediately following `"rwed"' flags.

   Please avoid using the `"h"' bit. Its meaning is undefined and it
may be reused by Amiga Technologies.

   When setting bits, `protect' returns 1 if the attempt succeeded, else
it returns a 0.  Getting the bits returns either the numeric value of
the protection status (see interpretation, above) or -1 upon failure.
Parameters:

`safe'

@{B}The `effect' statement (V44)
----------------------------@{UB}

     (effect <position> <effect> <color 1> <color 2>)

   The effect statement is special because it is interpreted before all
other commands in the script - independently of its position in the
script. Its arguments must be literals (string and integer constants)
and cannot be evaluated.

   If an effect is used Installer opens a new screen that is a clone of
the default public screen (Workbench screen).

   position sets the position of the installer window and must be one
of the following strings:

`upper_left'
     The window is placed in the upper left corner of the screen.

`upper_center'
     The window is horizontally centered in the upper part of the
     screen.

`upper_right'
     The window is placed in the upper right corner of the screen.

`center_left'
     The window is  vertically centered on the left side of the screen.

`center'
     The window is centered on the screen.

`center_right'
     The window is vertically centered on the right side of the screen.

`lower_left'
     The window is placed in the lower left corner of the screen.

`lower_center'
     The window is horizontally centered in the lower part of the
     screen.

`lower_right'
     The window is placed in the lower right corner of the screen.

   effect sets the graphical effect that is used for the background. It
is one of the following strings:

`horizontal'
     A fade from color 1 to color 2 with horizontal lines is drawn

`radial'
     A fade from color 1 to color 2 with circles around a point in the
     upper right corner of the screen is drawn.

   If the effect cannot be drawn due to the number of colors in the
screen the effect is replaced with an effect thats uses less colors. The
radial effect (only possible at true color screens) is replaced with
the horizontal fade. If the horizontal effect is not displayable it is
replaced with an animated fade.

   color 1 is an integer and sets the 24 bit RGB value that is used as
the first color. Typically a hexadecimal number is used.

   color 2 is an integer and sets the 24 bit RGB value that is used as
the second color. All effects fades from color 1 to color 2.

   showmedia opens a datatype (AmigaOS 3.0 is needed) and presents it
to the user. With the exception of sound and music datatypes a window
is opened with a given position and size to display the datatype. If
the datatype cannot be opened 0 is returned, if the datatype is opened
1 is returned.

   medianame is a string value. The value is used as a name of a
variable that gets a handle to the datatype. This variable has to be
used in the other media statements.

   filename is the name of the file to show.

   position is one of the following strings:

`upper_left'
     The window is placed in the upper left corner of the screen.

`upper_center'
     The window is horizontally centered in the upper part of the
     screen.

`upper_right'
     The window is placed in the upper right corner of the screen.

`center_left'
     The window is  vertically centered on the left side of the screen.

`center'
     The window is centered on the screen.

`center_right'
     The window is vertically centered on the right side of the screen.

`lower_left'
     The window is placed in the lower left corner of the screen.

`lower_center'
     The window is horizontally centered in the lower part of the
     screen.

`lower_right'
     The window is placed in the lower right corner of the screen.

   size is on of the following strings:

`none'
     The window gets its size from the datatype (for example the size
     of the picture).

`small'
     The window is small.

`small_medium'
     The window has a small width and a medium height.

`small_large'
     The window has a small width and a large height.

`medium_small'
     The window has a medium width and a small height.

`medium'
     The window is medium sized.

`medium_large'
     The window has a medium width and a large height.

`large_small'
     The window has a large width and a small height.

`large_medium'
     The window has a large width and a medium height.

`large'
     The window is large.

   If the borderflag is 1 the window gets a border with proprtional
sliders and arrows and a size gadget (prefered for Amiga guide files
and text files). If the borderflag is 0 the window gets no border at
all (prefered for pictures and animations).

   After the bordeflag more strings can follow which sets some
attributes of the datatype:

`wordwrap'
     A text is displaed using wordwrapping.

`panel'
     If the datatype has a control panel it is used (amigaguide and
     animation)

`play'
     The datatype shall start playing immediatly (animation)

`repeat'
     The datatype shall repeat playing (seems not to be supported by

     (trace)

   The trace statement sets a backtrace position. A retrace will
continue on that position in the script. You can set as many backtrace
positions as you want.

   Example:

     (trace)
     (message "one trace is set")
     (trace)
     (message "a second trace is set")
     (retrace)

   This example will run until the (retrace) statement and continue
with the first (trace) statement (one trace is skipped and the previous
one is used).  This is an endless loop that will always present both
message pages to the user.


@EndNode


@Node "cs_retrace" "installer.guide/cs_retrace"

@Prev "cs_trace"
@Toc "Control Statements"

@{B}The `retrace' statement (V44)
-----------------------------@{UB}

     (retrace)

   The retrace initiates the backtrace mechanism. It skips the last
backtrace position and searchs for the previous one.

   Backtrace positions get lost if the script leaves a scope.

   Example:

     (trace)
     (message "now follows an if statement")
     (if (= 1 1)
         ((trace) (message "then"))
         (message "else")
     )
     (trace)
     (retrace)

   The script skips back to the first (trace) statement and not into
the "then" part of the if statement. So you will see the messages "now
follows..." and "then" again and again (until you abort the script).

   Note: If you use the backtrace mechanism via trace and retrace it is
very important to divide you installer script into two sections: First
ask the user all questions and retrive all data you need. Second do all
the action like copying files.

   In the first section you should allow the user to go back at every
command with user interaction. In the second section don't use the
"back" parameter in the copyfiles, copylib etc commands.

   The reason for this is very simple: All the actions from copyfile to
startup and tooltype cannot be inverted easily. It is very difficult to
replace a library with the older version again once you used copylib.

   For the same reason askdisk should not have a back parameter: if the
disk is already installed the operation is a no-op. So if you inserted
a trace statement before that askdisk you get an endless loop:

     (trace)
     (askdisk ... (back (retrace)))
     
     (trace)
     (message "Try to go back" (back (retrace)))

   If the disk is already inserted askdisk is a no-op and the the user
cannot go back before the first trace statement which leads to an
endless loop.  Currently there is no easy way to avoid this besides not
using "trace" and "back" for the askdisk function.

   The same is true for other statements that may not interact with the
user like copylib which is a no-op if the file to be copied has no
higher version number than the file at the destination. But as said
before these statements should not use the backtrace mechanism at all.

@{B}User-Defined Procedures
=======================@{UB}

   The Installer has user-defined procedures (subroutines).  This
functionality is currently very primitive.  There are no local
variables. Starting with Installer V42.7, there is a convenient way to
pass arguments though, which is described below. To define a new
procedure, use the `procedure' command:

     (procedure <procedure-name> [<args>] <statements>)

   You can then call the procedure like this:

     (<procedure-name>)

   Note that `<procedure-name>' is not a string, just a symbolic name.
You @{B}should@{UB} use a prefix like `P_' for your names.  Otherwise they might
collide with future enhancements to Installer.

   The return value of a procedure is the value of the last statement
executed in the sequence of statements within the procedure.

   Easier argument passing is available starting with Installer V42.7.
`<args>' is a list of variable names. If you call the procedure with
any arguments, the variables will be set with these arguments. If you
leave out any arguments at the end, the corresponding variables will
retain their previous value. An example:

     (procedure P_ADDMUL arg1 arg2 arg3
         (* (+ arg1 arg2) arg3)
     )
     
     (message (P_ADDMUL 1 2 3))    ; shows 9
     (message (P_ADDMUL 4 5))      ; shows 27 as arg3 stays the same

you can specify a maximum of 32 possible choices.  Parameters:

   Parameters:

`prompt'
`help'
     tell the user what's going to happen.

`choices'
     a list of choice strings, such as `"Apples"', `"Cherries"', etc.

`default'
     the number of the default choice (defaults to 0)

@{B}NOTE:@{UB} Starting with Installer V42.6, you can do magic things with the

  2. Previous versions of Installer did not support proportional fonts
     well and some people depended on the non proportional layout of
     the display for table like choices.  So Installer will continue to
     render choices non proportional unless you start one of the

Returns -1 if the pathname is bad or information could not be obtained
from the filesystem even though pathname was valid.

   New for V44:

   The parameter <unit> is optional and defines the unit for the
returned disk space: "B" (or omitted) is "Bytes", "K" is "Kilobytes",
"M" is "Megabytes" and "G" is "Gigabytes".

   Typical hard drives are larger than 4 G today and partitions may
also be larger than 2 G. Older versions of Installer returns illegal
values for partitions larger than 2 GB. The new installer returns the
maximum integer (2147483647) if the partition is too large.

   If the named file has a RomTag with an ID string or a OS 2.x version
string, this will return the version number.  If filename is not
provided, then the version of the OS is returned instead.  Note that
this function does NOT assume files ending with `.library' or `.device'
reside in a particular place - the path must be included.  If
`resident' is specified, the function attempts to return version of
library or device in memory.  For example:

     (getversion "intuition.library" (resident))

   would return the version/revision of intuition.  Note that using the
`resident' parameter causes first the library and then the device list
to be checked.

   The version number is returned as a 32 bit value, where the high
order 16 bit word is the version and the low order word is the
revision.  Here are some sample statements to parse a version number:

     (set vernum (getversion "c:iconx"))
     (set ver (/ vernum 65536))
     (set rev (- vernum (* ver 65536) ) )
     
     (message

where the characters are:

`v'
     only match volumes

`a'
     only match logical assignments

`d'
     only match devices

   Therefore `a' would be equivalent to having no options.  Returns an
empty string on failure.

   Notes:

     `<name>' must be supplied without a colon; i.e.  `"ENV"' not
     `"ENV:"'. A variable previously set to name may be used in place
     of name.

     If a device name is used as the name and the search is limited to
     devices, then `getassign' will return the device or volume name if
     the device exists, otherwise it will return an empty string.  An
     example usage would be `(getassign "df1" "d")'.

     `getassign' cannot handle non-binding assigns due to an AmigaDOS

`dest'
     the name of the icon to be modified. There is no need to specify a
     `.info' extension.

`gettooltype'
     the tooltype name and result symbol name string.

`getdefaulttool'
     symbol name for the default tool name of a project.

`getstack'
     symbol name for the current stack size of the icon.

`getposition'
     Two symbol names for the saved icon position in X and Y direction.
     @{B}Do not use this lightly@{UB}. It is intended to keep icon positions
     on updates with help of the new parameter `setposition' of the

     lead to annoyed users due to different Workbench and font setups.
     If the icon doesn't have a position set, -1 is returned for the
     respective position value. This may be passed to @{"`tooltype'" Link "s_tooltype"}.

   If you specify the optional string `<checkvalue>', a boolean result
will be returned instead of a string result, showing if the string
result would match.  This is an exact match provided as convenience

=====================@{UB}

`(all)'
     In the `copyfiles' statement, specifies that all files are to be
     copied.

`(append <string>)'
     Within a `textfile' statement, will append the string to the
     textfile.

`(assigns)'
     An option used in the `askdisk' statement to indicate that logical
     assigns will match the askdisk request as well.

`(choices <string-1> <string-2> ...)'
     Used to display a series of checkmarks or radio buttons depending
     on the command used.  This is used in the `askchoice' and
     `askoptions' functions to indicate what choices the user has.  It
     can also be used in the `copyfiles' statement to specify that only
     certain files can be copied.  If absent, some other criterion will
     be used to determine which files to copy.

@{B}     NOTE:@{UB} Starting with Installer V42.6, you can do magic things with
     the `choices' when used with `askchoice' or `askoptions':

       1. If you use an empty string as choice descriptor, the choice
          will be invisible to the user, i.e. it will not be displayed
          on screen.  By using variables you can easily set up a
          programable number of choices then while retaining the bit
          numbering.

       2. Previous versions of Installer did not support proportional
          fonts well and some people depended on the non proportional
          layout of the display for table like choices.  So Installer
          will continue to render choices non proportional unless you
          start one of the choices with a special escape sequence
          `"<ESC>[2p"'. This escape sequence allows proportional
          rendering.


`(command <text> ...)'
     Specifies the text of a command to be inserted into the
     `S:User-Startup' file.  Argument strings are merged.

`(confirm <user-level>)'
     On some statements, the user will only be informed of the action
     and allowed to cancel it if the `confirm' option is specified.
     The user level can be `expert' or `average' `expert' is the
     default.

`(default <value>)'
     Specifies the default value of an askchoice, askstring, or
     asknumber action.

`(delopts <option> <option> ...)'
     Indicates to the `copyfiles', `copylib' and `delete' statements
     that the listed options should be @{B}removed@{UB} from the global internal
     list of options for this statement.  The default global option is
     "fail".

`(dest <filename>)'
     Specifies the file or directory to be modified as part of the
     command.

`(disk)'
     When used with the `rename' statement, specifies that a disk
     relabel operation is really desired.  When used with the `askdir'
     or `askfile' statement, specifies that a drive list should be shown
     initially instead of a file list.

`(fonts)'
     Indicates to the `copyfiles' statement that accompanying `.font'
     files are to be copied as well.

`(help <string-1> <string-2> ...)'
     This is used to specify the help text for each action.

`(infos)'
     Indicates to the `copyfiles' statement that accompanying `.info'
     files are to be copied as well. If the destination drawer does not
     exist, a default icon will be made for the drawer the Installer
     creates. It is also valid for the `delete' statement.

`(include <filename>)'
     Within a `textfile' statement, will append the listed file to the
     textfile.  If the file does not exist, the include will be ignored.

`(newname <name>)'
     Used in `copyfiles' to specify that a file will have a new name
     after being copied.  Used in `askdisk' to assign the new name to
     the inserted disk.  Used in `copylib' to specify that the library
     will have a new name after being copied.

`(newpath)'
     Used by `askdir' and `askfile' to allows non-existent paths to be
     supplied as the default drawer.

`(nogauge)'
     When used with the `copyfiles' and `copylib' statements this
     disables the copy status indicator.

`(noposition)'
     Used to modify the positioning of an icon to `NO_ICON_POSITION'.

`(pattern <string>)'
     Used in the `copyfiles' statement to specify a wildcard pattern.

`(prompt <string-1> <string-2> ...)'
     This is used to provide the "title" of the screen which explains
     to the user what this step does.

`(range <min> <max>)'
     Specifies the range of allowable numbers for an asknum statement.

`(safe)'
     This tells the Installer that an action not normally performed in
     Pretend mode should be performed.

`(setdefaulttool <value>)'
     Used to modify the default tool of an icon.

`(setstack <value>)'
     Used to modify the stack size included in an icon.

`(settooltype <tooltype> <value>)'
     Used to modify a tooltype to a certain value.  If the tooltype
     does not exist it will be created; if the `<value>' parameter is
     omitted, the tooltype will be deleted.  A tooltype without a value
     may be added in the following manner:

          (settooltype <tooltype-string> "")

     Remember that `(tooltype <tooltype-string>)' deletes the tooltype
     given.

`(source <filename>)'
     Specifies the file or directory to be read as part of this command.

`(swapcolors)'
     This is obsolete and should no longer be used.  It is here for
     backwards compatibility and serves no function.  @{B}DON'T USE IT!@{UB}

`(optional <option> <option> ...)'
     Indicates to the `copyfiles' and `copylib' statements that it is
     not a fatal error to have a copy fail.  Used for `delete' to
     indicate if deletion should be "forced".

`(resident)'
     Used for `getversion' to specify that the library and device list
     in memory should be searched.

`(back <code>)'
     Used to set the code for the backtrace mechanism. If the user
     press the "Back" button the code is executed. Typically this code
     will contain a (retrace) statement the last statement.

     Example:

          (set #copydoc (askbool (prompt "Do you want to install the documentation?")
                                 (help @askbool-help)
                                 (choices "Yes" "No")
                                 (back (retrace))

     You must set this parameter to enable the "Back" button.

     The back parameter is accpted by every command that has user
     interaction so it makes only little sense for copylib or startup
     or other actions that are not invertable easily.

@Prev "Summary of Parameters"
@Toc "Installer Language Reference"

@{B}Pre-Defined Variables
=====================@{UB}

   Pre-defined variables are available for use by the install script.
They may be modified on-the-fly, but their type may not be changed
(e.g.  from strings to numeric) unless it never had a value to begin
with.

`@abort-button'
     Replacement text for the `Abort Install' button.

`@app-name'
     The `APPNAME' value given at startup.

`@icon'
     The full pathname of the icon used to start the Installer not
     including any `.info' suffix on a WB start. This is not
     necessarily the script's icon! Starting with Installer V42.12,
     this variable will contain the full path to the script on a Shell
     start.

`@execute-dir'
     If this variable is set to a valid path, then the Installer will
     change directory to it whenever a `run' or `execute' statement is
     performed.

`@default-dest'
     The Installer's suggested location for installing an application.
     If you installed the application somewhere else (as the result of
     asking the user) then you should modify this value - this will
     allow the "final" statement to work properly.  Note that creating
     a drawer and putting the application in that drawer is considered
     installing the application somewhere else.  Set it to `""' if
     there really is no definite place that the "application" was
     installed.  The log file will be copied to the drawer indicated by
     `@default-dest' unless it was set to `""'.

`@language'
     Used to set the variable `@language'.  The default value for
     `@language' is the name of the current locale or "english".  The
     use of this variable is left up to the install script.

`@pretend'
     The state of the Pretend flag (1 if Pretend mode).

`@user-level'
     The user-level the script is being run at:  0 for novice, 1 for
     average, 2 for expert.

`@installer-version'
     An integer representing the current version of Installer.  The
     value matches the one that `getversion' would return for Installer.
     This variable is available starting with Installer V42.

`@error-msg'
     The text that would have been printed for a fatal error, but was
     overridden by a trap statement.

`@special-msg'
     If a script wants to supply its own text for any fatal error at
     various points in the script, this variable should be set to that
     text.  The original error text will be appended to the special-msg
     within parenthesis.  Set this variable to `""' to clear the
     special-msg handling.

`@ioerr'
     The value of the last DOS error.  Can be used in conjunction with
     the `trap' statement to learn more about what an error occurred.
     Starting with Installer V42, this variable is also set by the
     `run', `execute', and `rexx' statements.

`@each-name'
`@each-type'
     Used in a `foreach' loop (see above).

`@askoptions-help'
`@askchoice-help'
`@asknumber-help'
`@askstring-help'
`@askdisk-help'
`@askfile-help'
`@askdir-help'
`@copylib-help'
`@copyfiles-help'
`@makedir-help'
`@startup-help'
     Default help text for various functions.  These can be appended to
     the explanation provided for a particular action or used as is.

     abort requester.

     Can add assigns to `S:User-Startup', and adds lines to
     `S:Startup-Sequence' if necessary to make sure `S:User-Startup' is
     executed upon boot-up. Uses the boot volume for `S:'.

@{B}Quick Language Overview
=======================@{UB}

     Language is LISP-like (lots of parentheses (()) (-:).

     Variables are typeless (a la ARexx), i.e.  strings and numbers are
     treated interchangeably.

     Strings are delimited with `"' or `''.

     Certain embedded sequences are available for strings:
    `\\\\n'
          newline character

    `\\\\r'
          return character

    `\\\\t'
          tab character

    `\\\\h'
          horizontal tab character (V42.6)

    `\\\\v'
          vertical tab character (V42.6)

    `\\\\b'
          backspace character (V42.6)

    `\\\\f'
          formfeed character (V42.6)

    `\\\\"'
          double quote

    `\\\\''
          single quote

    `\\\\\\\\'
          backslash

    `\\\\ooo'
          some octal number `ooo' (V42.6)

    `\\\\xXX'
          some hex number `XX' (V42.6)

     Statements go in parentheses ( ).  The general format is:
     `(operator <operand1> <operand2> ...)'

     E.g., to assign the value `5' to the variable `x', use `(set x 5)'

     To produce the sum of two numbers, use `(+ 5 9)'

     Note that there is no difference between operators and functions-
     the function 'set' and the arithmetic operator '+' are both used
     exactly the same way.

     Combining statements:  A statement can be used as the operand to
     another statement.  E.g.:

          (set x (+ 3 5))

     In this case, the statement `(+ 3 5)' is evaluated first, and the
     result is 8.  You can think of this as having the `(+ 3 5)' part
     being replaced by an 8, leaving:

          (set v 8)

     Note that the `(+ 3 5)' part actually produced a value: `8'.  This
     is called the "result" of the statement.  Many statements return
     results, even some that might surprise you (such as `set' and
     `if').

     Comments are preceded with a semi-colon `;'

     Hex numbers are preceded with a `$' (e.g. `$23').

     Binary numbers are preceded with a `%' (e.g. `%0101').

     Many statements return a value which can be used in assignments,
     tests, etc.

     Data can be formatted using a string literal with argument
     placemarkers, for example:

          ("I am %ld foot %ld inches tall." 6 3)
          ;Produces a string with %ld's replaced with 6 and 3.
          ;Remember that decimal values must be specified as longwords.
