ReqOnOff
--------

Template: ON/S, OFF/S, TOGGLE/S

If AmigaDOS openes a dialog requester ("Please inseret volume "foobar" into
any drive") it typically uses the Workbench screen to open it. ReqOnOff
is used to tell the process not to open any AmigaDOS dialogs anymore.

ON: allow AmigaDOS requesters

OFF: forbid AmigaDOS requesters

TOGGLE: toggle status of AmigaDOS requesters

ReqOnOff returns 5 (WARN) if the AmigaDOS requesters are disabled on exit.
