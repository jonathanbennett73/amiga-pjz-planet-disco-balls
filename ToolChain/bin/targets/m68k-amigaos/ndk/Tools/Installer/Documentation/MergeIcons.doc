MergeIcons

Template: FROM,TO/A/M,WITH/K,MSS=MINSTACKSIZE/K/N,FP=FREEPOS/S,X/K/N,Y/K/N,BL=BORDERLESS/S

Replace the palette images of destination icons with the image of the 
source icon(s). Modify stacksize and free position. The old icon image
(plain format, no palette) or NewIcons tooltypes are not modified or
deleted.

FROM: If the FROM parameter is a directory for every destination icon a source
icon with the same filename from this directory is loaded. If the FROM
parameter is a file this icon is used for all destination icons.

TO: A pattern to select the destination icons. To replace all images in the
current directory us "?#?.info". This will not try to change the ".info" file
but all other icons.

WITH: A with-file allows to use source icons that depends patterns or
datatypes. A with file descripes one source icon with one line of text
with the following template: CLASS/A/N,TYPE/A,FILE/A. CLASS is 0 for 
pattern matching, and 1 for datatype examination. TYPE is a pattern
(if CLASS is 0) or a datatype descriptor (if CLASS is 1). FILE is the
full path of the source icon (without .info suffix).

Example:

1  ILBM              SYS:Storage/Icons/iffpic
1  JPEG              SYS:Storage/Icons/jpegpic
0  #?.iff            SYS:Storage/Icons/iff
0  #?                SYS:Storage/Icons/blank

Note: The with-file only works for icons that has a file attached. It does
not work for icons without an attached file (for example a project icon to
start an application per default-tool).

MINSTACKSIZE: Set the stack size of the icon to at least this value.

FREEPOS: Free the position of the icon.

X: Set the X position of the icons to this value.

Y: Set the Y position of the icons to this value.

BORDERLESS: Make the icons borderless.

Note: A destination file that is not an icon is not an error. If the icon
can not be loaded (source or destination) MergeIcons continues with the
next destination icon.

Note: MergeIcons does only merge icons: the image of a source icon is
written to a destination icon. It is not able to create new icons
for files without an icon.

Note: To workaround buggy file systems which do not allow changing files
while scanning a directory all filenames are now put into a list and
handled after scanning is done. This may need a lot of memory for scanning
large drives from the root.
