If you want to have a quick look on the EuroCalc resource file do the
following (due to the beta state of ReActor):

1. Start ReActor

2. Select menu item Project/Load.

3. Enter PROGDIR/Examples/EuroCalc and select EuroCalcFrame.res

4. Press "O_pen" to open the window.

This drawer contains an AREXX script catcomp.srx which can be used for
StormC. Create a StormC project, add all C sources, headers, catalog and
object files and add catcomp.srx as makescript for the catalog file.
