- Fixed a bug in the library initialization code.

- Simplified the valid char match code a bit.

ascii 45.1 (27.2.01)
- truncates lines longer than 30000 pixels, should fix problems with
  really long lines

ascii 45.2 (1.3.01)
- TextFit() doesn't like strings longer than 32767 characters (returns wrong
  results then). Added a workaround. Should hopfully fix the remain long line
  problems
