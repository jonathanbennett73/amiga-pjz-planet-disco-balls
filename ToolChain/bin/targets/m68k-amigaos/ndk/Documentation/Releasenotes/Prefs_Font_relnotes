Font 44.10 (16.7.99)

 The problem with "asl requester does not open after the first time" is a
  problem with window.class.

Font 44.11 (31.7.99)

 Added stack extension

Font 44.13 (17.8.99)

퇏added close gadget for window

 change Save/Use/Cancel button layout

 moved sample to top of window

 fixed a bug with large icon fonts overwriting the window borders

Font 44.14 (8.9.99)

 if the SYS:Disk.info icon could not be loaded the sample was not shown. Now
  the default icon fallback is used. This should help Scalos displaying the
  sample (can't imagine other reasons than this).

Font 44.15 (16.9.99)

 changed icon name to def_font_prefs.

 Sample did not draw sys images correctly if VisualPrefs was installed.

 if Font is started on Workbench Screen the Workbench Patterns are used
  as backdrops in the sample.

 Sample is now Visual-Prefs compatible.

Font 44.16 (22.9.99)

퇏removed some debugging code

 removed unneeded BltBitMap()

Font 44.17 (27.9.99)

 One more sys image was not drawn correctly if a sysiclass patch was 
  installed (screen depth image)

 Deadlock if Sample was refreshed while IPrefs updates WB patterns.

Font 44.25 (17.11.99)

퇏Sample use different backdrops: WB Backdrop in screen, WB drawer in WB 
  drawer window.

Font 44.26 (21.12.99)

 Options USE and SAVE were broken.
