jpeg.datatype 44.1 (13.4.99)

- Bumped to V44.


jpeg.datatype 44.2 (9.8.99)

- For greyscale output, no longer sets the picture's colour palette.
  This is done implicitely by picture.datatype now.


jpeg.datatype 44.3 (4.9.99)

- Replaced the descriptor file. The old one was limiting the files
  recognized by this datatype to JFIF-format files only. The IJG
  library can read more than just this format. The new descriptor
  takes care of this now.


jpeg.datatype 44.4 (26.9.2000)

- Rewrote the data type recognition function which is part of the
  descriptor file. It now resembles the scanner the JPEG code uses,
  which allows it to identify JPEG format files which the old
  recognition function could not. This includes formats such as the
  thumbnail files created by digital cameras.
