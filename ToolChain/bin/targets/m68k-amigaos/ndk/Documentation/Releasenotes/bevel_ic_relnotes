bevel.image 45.1 (18.11.2000)

 settings REACTION_ChangePrefs (is now done before openeing window) changed
  interpretation of style due to preferences. The "field" type was not longer
  converted to inverted "group" type in XEN and thin XEN style.

 expunging the library did not delete the memory pool. Possible this was 
  the biggest memory leak you see if you test with "avail flush".


bevel.image 45.2 (28.02.2001)

 the image never freed its temporary rastports when it had no label.

 FreeClass() is allowed to fail which was ignored by this class.


bevel.image 45.3 (03.03.2001)

 while trying to fix the NewYork/getfont.gadget bug, I found
  out that bevel.image threw a lot of hits when NY couldn't
  load its speedbar images. Once again this stupid StrUCpy()
  function of classact ...


bevel.image 45.4 (09.03.2001)

 changed placement of text (1 pixel down) so that it matches
  the text placement of the other ReAction classes. The underscore
  moved a 1 pixel up. I think it was Mario, who requested this 
  change in 1999.

 the IM_FRAMEBOX method interpreted the resolution parameter
  of the DrawInfo structure as screen size in pixels and not as
  screen aspect ratio.


bevel.image 45.5 (17.03.2001)

 changed vertical "in bevel" text placement, so that it is really
  centered.
