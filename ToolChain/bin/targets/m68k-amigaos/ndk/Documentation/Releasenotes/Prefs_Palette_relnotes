Palette 44.3 (19.7.99)

 If a screen had not enough free pens for editing 8 colors a new screen
  should be opened. Now it does!

Palette 44.4 (31.7.99)

 added stack extension

 color sliders no longer flicker while dragging colorwheel or gradient slider

Palette 44.5 (10.8.99)

 fixed a typo "no colowheel"

 fixed a small bug which broke the slecting of pens from sample.

Palette 44.6 (11.8.99)

 restricted gradientslider to 6 exlusive pens which still looks quite good.

Palette 44.7 (12.8.99)

 a small change for the DrawInfo but a big boom for the Amiga (tried to set
  the depth of a hand made DrInfo to GetBitMapAttr() but this doesn't work
  on Hi/True color screens. Returned to screen->BitMap.Depth).

 removed the senseless minwidth/minheight for the "No Color Wheel!" button.

Palette 44.9 (16.8.99)

 improved selection of pen from listbrowserand pen palette: less flickering

Palette 44.10 (17.8.99)

 moving the gradient slider to black caused a color change to 0/0/0. Fixed.

 moving the colorwheel knob flickered. Fixed.

 added close gadget

 added seperator line

 modified Save/use/Cancel layout

 moved sample to top of window

 bringing the window to front (start Palette second time) created the menu
  strip again, waisted memory and trashed checkmark items

 RGB/HSB menu items were not marked as mututal exclude items. Not a problem
  with AmigaOS menus but with MagicMenu.

 less flickering for selecting from sample

 changed refresh call for color palette on hi/true color screen for less
  flickering

Palette 44.11 (20.8.99)

 added some code to make selected pen visible in list

Palette 44.12 (8.9.99)

Palette 44.13 (16.9.99)

퇏changed project icon name to def_palette_prefs.

 new default palette

 RGB values are now always using values from 0 to 255 instead of the real
  hardware dependend resolution.
