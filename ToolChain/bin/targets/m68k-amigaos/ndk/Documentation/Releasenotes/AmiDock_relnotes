AmiDock 45.0 (03.11.2000)
- first release.
  Most functions should work, but some stuff is still to clean
  up and there are still some functions missing. It is now 5:33 at
  mornig -  too late for me to describe anything more....
  Prepare for the next versions... :-)

AmiDock 45.1 (05.11.2000)
- added menu-items and buttons for Save, Use, Cancel
- AmiDock now uses the ENV: and ENVARC: settings for Use, Save, etc.
- AmiDock interprets the closewindow-event of the Configwindow as Save.
- now supports Worbench-params for Drag&Drop files on a program
  located in a dock (e.g. open a file with MultiView via Drag&Drop)
- removed a problem when removing categories (last category-sizes
  were stored in the next active category)
- AmiDock now is a commodity.
- removed a problem with drawing NewIcons.
- every dock is now automatically put to front if there is a move or size event
- AmiDock is now full localized. German catalog is already finished.

AmiDock 45.2 (09.11.2000)
- removed some localisation typos
- some english original texts were unfortunately not shown in V45.1. fixed.
- removed a problem with start from WB. This was a very silly bug which could
  indeed cause a crash... :((
- close gadget of config-window is now on general request identical to a
  "Cancel" all prefs programs do it this way, too...
- the program path of the wb program to run is now set correctly
- every dock has now a "Edit..."-category which allows to easy edit a dock
- changed a lot of internal code. is now much better... :)
- removed the non-opaque-mode. nobody needs it as the move and resize is fast
  enough also on slow machines / gfx-chips.
- changed - or better: removed the renaming-button. now it works as everyone
  wants it
- entering a new backgrouund in the background string-inputs didn't change
  the background. fixed.
- changed (rearranged) some buttons, changed the Move-Up/Down-buttons
- AmiDock now doesn't reopen its docks if there was no change in the config

AmiDock 45.3 (10.11.2000)
- the window-sizes of a category were not saved in 45.2, this was caused
  by an forgotten update of a method in V45.2. fixed.
- on category moveup / movedown the dock-popup was not refreshed correctly

AmiDock 45.4 (14.11.2000)
- the started program now no longer is called by it's *complete* filename
  (path + name), now the path is set to the program path and the program name
  gets called.
- AmiDock temporalily locked a Drag&Dropped file which prevented the called
  program to make a write-access to the dropped file. fixed.
- AmiDock now uses a ReAction user interface which is faster, smaller and
  much more system friendlier (memory consumption) than the old Wizard GUI.
  **                                                      **
  *** Many thanks to Jochen Becher for his great help!!! ***
  **                                                      **
- The while config window GUI was redesigned, it now should also fit on low
  resolutions
- removed "action" group. the icon defines the action already.
  if you want to call shell- or arexx-scripts, just create an icon for it.
  this is one much more flexible
- new locale file AmiDock.cd which replaces the old one.
- a new window.class (45.2) helps solving the "hanging opaque resize/drag"
  introduced with the ReAction GUI.
  With older window.class the window is not correctly relayouted after
  category change.
- every dock can now have its own user-defined name
- selecting the current category again from popup redrawed the dock
  without any sense
- pressing and holding the left mouse button on a icon and moving it over
  the sizeborder showd the size-style mousepointer. senseless. fixed.
- the ASL requester now shows the path of the entry of the corresponding
  string-gadget
- when removing a icon from the list, now the next icon gets selected.
  this helps a lot if you want to remove more than one icon.
- the sizeborder was not always shown correct (hidden even if was set in
  config). fixed.

AmiDock 45.5 (15.11.2000)
- removed some typos in the localisation
- cleaned up the locale file
- removed the upper limit of 5 docks simultaneously. now there is a
  unlimited number of docks possible.
- in V45.3 I disabled for testing purposes Commodity support.
  activated again.
- the docks were switched to front when resized, moved, etc.
  this is not like other windows are handled. fixed.
- Workbench objects are now started finally in the correct way.
  Bug was discovered because GoldEd showed problems when dropping
  files on it. fixed.
- now when you drag a file over an AmiDock icon, the icon gets selected
  to show that if you drop the icon, it will be used as argument for
  the program which got selected
- removed a problem with the layouter - it sometimes ignored text-labels
  and painted over them.
- the layout process in earlier AmiDock releases could hide one char of
  an icon name which should create a new line. fixed.
- did a small change in the GUI [popup gadget]

AmiDock 45.6 (16.11.2000)
- AmiDock now also supports the Workbench replacement of OpusMagellan.
  You now can at least run applications (also with Drag&Drop parameters).
  ** But you can't open Drawers or Disks **
  ** Drop Zone highlighting is under Opus also impossible! **
- the category sized were still sometimes not restored correctly.
  this problem is now definitely fixed.
- the category add-button had a wrong width-priority. fixed.
- new button "Sort": the icon list now can be sorted by program names
- when canceling config, AmiDock ignoered the ENVARC:-config, so if
  there was no ENV:-config, AmiDock couldn't restore it's config. fixed.
- AmiDock does now do a automatic stack extension
- when having more than one dock, selecting "Edit..." now selects the
  according dock-item of the dock listview, too.

AmiDock 45.7 (19.11.2000)
- Ctrl-C now closes AmiDock
- Ctrl-E now iconfies AmiDock, Ctrl-F uniconfies it again
- the iconify-gadget of the configwindow now works
- added a menu item "Iconify"
- the configwindow is now an appwindow; it allows now to add icons to
  the current dock and category using Drag&Drop into the configwindow, too.
- the docks now aren't activated on startup anymore
- now using Mario Cattaneo very nice icon. Thanks Mario!
- removed a bug with resizing the window. in some situations, if you
  sized for example with an horizonal dock to the right screen-border,
  the dock increased in with and moved pixel by pixel to the left...
- the size-border could be "clicked" one pixel in the outer area of the
  dock-window, too. fixed.
- added a new snapto-option: "Locked". the dock can now be made immoveable
- the config window has now a more usable height when opened for the
  first time
- the about requester now also shows the version number of AmiDock
- fixed a problem with unremoved borders when workbench prefs borders
  were for example set to large.
- the (background-)images used in AmiDock now should be a little bit
  more "Pen-friendly" by reducing the dither quality (I hope, at least...)
- a double click onto a dock brings the dock to front

AmiDock 45.8 (20.11.2000)
- AmiDock now also uniconifies and shows its configwindow if the user
  starts a new AmiDock.
- forgot to allow to drag&drop multiple files on the config window. fixed.
- the docks aligned one pixel to high or one pixel to left on the
  screen borders
- on request, I reduced the configwindow startsize again
- AmiDock hid the last (rightmost/bottom-most) icon in the dock when
  changing the snapto option. fixed.
- changed slightly the icon

AmiDock 45.9 (21.11.2000)
- iconifying AmiDock now doesn't cause anymore a lost of a (possibly)
  changed config. iconifying now is equal to "Use" in configwindow.
- when runned from shell, AmiDock couldn't get under some cases not
  it's icon. for scenario: current dir "SYS:", user runs
  wbstartup/amidock... AmiDock couldn't get "AmiDock.info". fixed.
- Mario finally finished and cleaned up "AmiDock.info". Thanks Mario!

AmiDock 45.10 (22.11.2000)
- AmiDock now finally gets it's own icon without problems
  [for iconify reasons]
- AmiDock now uses the current icon font setting for displaying the
  icon labels
- AmiDock has now also a notify on the font prefs, whenever the user
  changes the current font prefs, AmiDock will reopen with the new
  font applied setting.

AmiDock 45.11 (23.11.2000)
- added the auto-hide/iconify of AmiDock when WB wants to close/refresh.
  this allows to change the screenmode without quitting AmiDock!
- there was a problem with drawing icon-labels where already the first
  character had a greater width than the icon itself. fixed.

AmiDock 45.12 (24.11.2000)
- introduced by accident a crash with AmiDock V45.11 when drag&dropping
  icons to AmiDock. shame one me... :(  fixed.

AmiDock 45.13 (24.11.2000)
- the Cancel-Button in the configwindow didn't work when the user added
  icons an did want to cancel the addition. fixed.
- AmiDock calculated the max width and height for the autosize-feature
  not correctly. this led to a about two columns (or two rows in
  vertical mode) smaller dock than it would have been possible. fixed.
