DefIcons 45.0 (27-10-00)

- just a version bump, no functional change.


DefIcons 45.1 (15-02-01)

- implemented arexx function "Identify NAME/A", the
  arexxport name is DEFICONS. Requires arexx.class v44.


DefIcons 45.2 (26-02-01)

- added NOREXX/S option for those who don't want
  the arexx interface (saves ~10kb of ram:)

- added a small cache that can hold upto 3 icons
  in memory. This gives a speed increase of about 
  20% for drawers that contain a lot of files of the
  same type. For "mixed" drawers there will be
  probably no speed increase or even the speed
  will drop. Please test!


DefIcons 45.3 (17-04-01)

- removed NOREXX option and the implementation
  of the arexx host through arexx.class. The
  program uses the SimpleRexx.c functions, now.
  The reason for doing this was that I got some
  strange enforcer hits from the interface
  although I can remember that the arexx stuff
  worked hit free the last time I've tested it.

- just for fun, the program can be terminated
  by sending "Quit" to the host, now.


DefIcons 45.4 (14-09-01)

- better SFS support.
