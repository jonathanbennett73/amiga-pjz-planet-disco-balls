mathieeedoubbas.library	45.1

- Fixed a stupid bug in IEEEDCmp(). It ordered some numbers
  wrongly, namely negative numbers whose two most significant
  mantissa long words are equal.

- Added support for the fpsp.resource. If this resource is
  present, emulation of the unsupported FINT and FINTRZ
  instruction of the 68040 are passed to the resource
  instead of requiring an emulator trap. This is more
  multitasking friendly and, too, faster.

mathieeedoubbas.library	45.2

- Fixed the startup code which would have crashed in case it
  would have run out of memory. *Shudder*.

- Removed the ancient support code for 68881/882 FPUs installed
  as IO devices by means of the mathieee resource. The performance
  of these cards was rather poor anyhow, and they aren't widely
  spreat, over-aged, obsolete and partially useless. Note that
  this does not affect FPUs bound into the system in the form of
  a coprocessor (which is the standard alternative anyhow).

- Reworked the library vector init a bit, uses now relative offsets
  instead of absolute addresses, making the binary quite reasonably
  smaller.

mathieeedoubbas.library	45.3

- The library startup code used the FPU code even if the FPU support
  code was never loaded. This would cause nothing bad except on the
  68060 where a new exec dispatcher must be patched in before the FPU
  can be initialized safely. Hence, this could have crashed badly.

mathieeedoubbas.library 45.3 (no new release)

- Included new autodoc files for all math-libraries documenting
  the changes made for V45.
