--- development taken over by Martin Steigerwald ---

AmigaMail 44.32 (11.5.2001)
- Adapted sources to StormGCC4
- StormGCC: Changed all functions using parameter passing in 
  registers to GCC syntax
- StormGCC: Added quite some missing casts, corrected some others
- StormGCC: Re-implemented SAS/C specific stccpy()
- StormGCC: Re-implemented some needed SAS/C classact.lib linker library 
  functions and imported some written by Stephan Rupprecht. Thanks.
- Fixed version tag
- Changed copyright notice
- Changed layout of address book entry. IMHO it was far to wide, thus
  I placed all address entry fields vertically now
- When opening the address book and no entry is selected the entry
  field gadgets are disabled now so that the user realizes he has
  to add an entry before being able to edit it
- Modularized saving address book entry data
- Still does not work correctly, address book broken, mails can't be 
  displayed. Something wrong in the calling of some aml.library 
  functions like CreateAddressEntry() in am_adrbook.c

AmigaMail 44.33 (12-15.5.2001)
- FD file for aml.library was wrong. Now AmigaMail should work as 
  expected (Stephan Rupprecht)
- Added stack extension code (Stephan)
- Audio playback fixed. SDTA_SignalBit expects mask (Stephan)
- timer.device handling fixed (Stephan)
- Compose message fixed: From was set to Reply-To and Reply-To
  was not set at all (Stephan)

AmigaMail 44.34 (16.5.2001)
- changed order of address book fields, name and email are now the
  first two
- now uses its own icon as appicon 
- now uses MSG_AM_NAME as appicon name (fixes ID 1430)
- now allows downloading mails even if inbox is not selected
  (fixes ID 1206)
- now doesn't try to FreeDiskObject() the appicon anymore as this
  is done by window.class. Fixes crash on exit.
- fixed uppercasing config keywords when loading "AmigaMail.hosts" file

AmigaMail 44.35 (17.5.2001)
- fixed broken modularization of am_main.c done previously when 
  converting AmigaMail to StormC: this fixes not freeing a pending 
  timer request before the timer was closed and also automatic 
  POP download should work again 
- nevertheless made TIMER_Cleanup and TIMER_Start in am_timer.c safer: 
  They now will always stop a possibly running TIMER request before
  doing their work
- removed some uncommented printf's, saved over 5KB code size

AmigaMail 44.36 (17.5.2001)
- just a revision bump 

AmigaMail 45.1 (31.5.2001)
- version bump
- adrbook: automatic save in addressbook, user no longer needs to 
  press return in gadgets
- adrbook: fixed creating a new address book entry: AmigaMail created
  one empty entry and saved all the data the user inputted to a different
  entry ID not displaying the data anymore when clicking to another
  entry and then back to the freshly created one and creating two
  entries instead of one
- adrbook: fixed saving inputted fields to different field, e.g. 
  ICQ to FTP and stuff like that, if one uses defines for gadget IDs,
  one should use them everywhere ;)
  One exception: FTP is set to URL, needs to be fixed in aml.library >44.20
- muForce hit when sending a mail immediately via compose mail window 
  before any folder has been opened in the folder window removed
- replaced the utterly complicated way of sending messages via 
  Message/Marked/Send spooled by a simple always selectable
  Project/Send spooled messages menu entry
- added a menu entry to get and send messages in one go
- removed folder menu texts from NewMenu structure, will be localized
  in anyway
- expunging deleted messages now also updates the index so that those
  message really get deleted (i.e. moved to trash or deleted when in trash)
  they will be removed from the folder display immediately now
- sending queued messages now also expunges the deleted messages and 
  removes them from the spool folder display, they have been copied to 
  the outbox folder anyway
- TODO: when composing a mail when and selecting to put it in the spool
  folder while the spool folder is being displayed in the folder window
  the index of the folder window will not really be refreshed.

AmigaMail 45.2 (7.6.2001)
- Compose: Fixed Send message menu item, (fixes ID 2311, David Rey)
- Compose: Actually implements "Cancel" menu item, (fixes ID 2311, David Rey)
- Compose: Now the hits when spooling or drafting a mail before an folder
  was opened in the main window are also gone (fixes ID 2310, David Rey)
- Adrbook: Unable to find the exact cause of the hits when switching 
  between address book entries. They only happen when AmigaMail was started
  from Workbench. They happen exactly when AmigaMail calls aml.library/
  OpenAddressEntry(). I looked at that routine, too, but can't imagine
  what exactly is causing the hit. Needs further research (ID 2309, David Rey)
 
AmigaMail 45.3 (13.6.2001)
- Redone the changes done for AmigaMail 45.2 except the debug output.
  These changes were lost due to a harddisk crash.
- Made sure there is no other debug output in AmigaMail activated anymore
