FixFonts 45.1 (22.10.2000)

- This is a recompile of my FixFonts 40.2. It
  is not based on the CBM/Amiga FixFonts, but
  does the same and works in a similar way.
  Additionally to what pre 45 FixFonts does,
  this release will also rebuild the cache for
  you if caching is turned on. Note that this is
  usually not required since diskfont is now
  smart enough to rewrite the cache anyhow. In
  fact, all what FixFonts does is to run an
  AvailFonts() and hence to trigger the rewrite.
  Except that, it is identically to former releases.

- Bumped to V45.

- Note that this release of FixFonts, as well as
  the original CBM FixFonts uses ExAll() to read
  the font directories, even while working on them.
  This has two inherent problems: First of all,
  ExAll() is severely broken in some filing systems
  as for example in AFS. Just don't use AFS!
  Second, creating files in a directory while
  scanning it via ExAll() or Examine() is dangerous
  due to the "ingenious" ExAll()/Examine() "design".
  FixFonts tries to work around this problem by
  providing a relatively large buffer for ExAll().
  Bummer.

FixFonts 45.2 (24.07.2001)

- FixFonts clears now explicitly the cache, even though
  this would not be necessary if the file system would
  advance the date of the FONTS: directory correctly.
