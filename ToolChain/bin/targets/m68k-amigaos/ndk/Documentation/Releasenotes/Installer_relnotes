installer 44.7 (7.8.99)

 askdir had no "Back" button

 askfile's "Back" button didn't work at all

 askoptions and askchoice did not reset the gadgets if "Back" button was 
pressed so the script crashed in most cases

 changed documentation for backtrace mechanism: it should only be used for
information retreival.

 some scripts used confirm parameter wrong (parameter was expected to be
a string not integer) which results in enforcer hits instead of error
message. Now it accepts a string ("expert") or an integer (like (user)
command).

 Added reboot statement. It is not executed in pretend mode.

 Added workbench object control (openwbobject, showwbobject, closewbobject).
