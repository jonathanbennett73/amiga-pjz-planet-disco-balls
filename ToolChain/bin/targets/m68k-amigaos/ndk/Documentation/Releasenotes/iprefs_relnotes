iprefs 44.1 (11.4.99)

- No longer does a dangerous segment split.

- The stack size is now inherited from the parent CLI.

- No longer uses the small data model.


iprefs 44.2 (11.4.99)

- No longer puts itself into danger of holding onto the IntuitionBase
  master lock and triggering an OpenScreenTagList() call before
  that lock is released.


iprefs 44.3 (13.4.99)

- Window and screen patterns are now allocated as friend bitmaps.
  This greatly improves Workbench window update performance.


iprefs 44.4 (25.4.99)

- Switched over to smake.


iprefs 44.5 (15.5.99)

- A change in the printergfx.prefs file now also causes the printer.prefs
  file to be reread.


iprefs 44.6 (12.6.99)

- Before notifying Intuition about changes in the palette.prefs file,
  Workbench is now notified and asked to let go of its icon colour
  palette. After the palette is changed, Workbench is then notified
  again and asked to reallocate its icon colours again.


iprefs 44.7 (27.6.99)

- Added new, safer colour expansion code for pattern filling.

- Fixed a memory leak in the pattern allocation code.


iprefs 44.8 (7.8.99)

- Added support for the workbench.prefs and reaction.prefs
  configuration files. The reaction preferences configuration
  code still uses the global semaphore name "CLASSACT-PREFS",
  which it should not.


iprefs 44.9 (11.8.99)

- Updating any preferences would cause the hidden device list to
  be cleared. Fixed.

- Increased the IPrefs process stack size to 8192 bytes. This
  fixed a few inexplicable crashes.

- The global reaction semaphore now bears the name "REACTION-PREFS".


iprefs 44.10 (17.8.99)

- Now properly supports empty hidden device lists.


iprefs 44.11 (22.8.99)

- Changing the Workbench palette now also causes the
  wbpattern.prefs file to be reread.

- Now supports the window/screen pattern precision and
  quality options.


IPrefs 44.12 (9.9.99)

- Changing the pointer colours now also causes the
  Workbench icons to be remapped.


IPrefs 44.13 (10.9.99)

- Changing the pointer colours now also causes the wbpattern.prefs
  file to be reread.

- The IPrefs semaphore is now semi-public, to allow the Workbench
  fill patterns to be accessed from outside.


IPrefs 44.14 (11.9.99)

- Cleaned up the code that loads the Workbench backdrop patterns.


IPrefs 44.15 (17.9.99)

- More cleanup work, this time affecting the global semaphore
  data structures.


IPrefs 44.16 (18.9.99)

- Implemented limited FastIPrefs compatibility. This means for
  example that the WBPattern prefs file chunks written by
  the FastIPrefs version of that program will be understood
  by IPrefs now. Workbench in turn supports the FastIPrefs
  centering and fill options now.


IPrefs 44.17 (20.9.99)

- Rebuilt without internal header files and stub code, trying
  to save some space.


IPrefs 44.18 (20.9.99)

- More tweaking for better FastIPrefs compatibility.


IPrefs 44.19 (25.9.99)

- Changing the pointer palette or the screen palette preferences
  no longer resets and remaps the icons but attempts to close
  and reopen the Workbench screen. This should be the cleanest
  solution.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IPrefs 44.20 (7.10.99)

- Changed the order in which the Workbench backdrop pattern loader code
  obtains the semaphores. The code also protects itself better against
  changes in backdrop data structures now.


IPrefs 44.21 (6.11.1999)

- The backdrop pattern loader code no longer shows error requesters
  while it holds onto more than one semaphore for protection. It now
  loads the data, remembers which picture didn't load, releases the
  semaphores and then complains about the problems it encountered.


IPrefs 44.22 (10.11.1999)

- Found a bug which could wreck the limited FastIPrefs compatibility
  (and which did wreck it most of the time). Fixed.


IPrefs 44.23 (30.11.1999)

- The code didn't properly cache SysBase, leading to a slowdown. Fixed.


IPrefs 45.1 (29.10.2000)

- Added support for the new ASL preferences settings.


IPrefs 45.3 (2.11.2000)

- The ASL preferences file did not get processed. Fixed.

- The IPrefs global semaphore now holds a copy of the IControl
  flags value (string gadget filter options, etc.).


IPrefs 45.4 (14.11.2000)

- Added support for the new picture.datatypes feature to scale pictures.

- For a reload of the picture, not only the filename may have changed, but
  also the flags (dither quality, scaling, ...).

- Fixed a bug that caused a reload of every pattern for Workbench, Window
  and Screen, even if only one or none of them has changed, without freeing
  the old unchanged pattern.


IPrefs 45.5 (17.11.2000)

- Added support for Workbench to hide the screen titlebar, hide the gauge, 
  lock the MagicWB pens and set the memory type for the icons.


IPrefs 45.6 (20.11.2000)

- Improved the handling for locking the colors for MagicWB icons.

- Support for 1:1 aspect ratio sysi classes.


IPrefs 45.7 (21.11.2000)

- Fix: for removing the gauge, all workbench windows should be closed
  to avoid a lock.


IPrefs 45.8 (23.11.2000)

- Improved the determination, if the 1:1 aspect ration for the size image
  should be used.


IPrefs 45.9 (24.11.2000)

- Fix: the determination, if the new SysIClasses should be used for a
  certain screen, caused a lock under certain circumstances.


IPrefs 45.10 (10.01.2001)

- Fix: OpenWindow() lost its TagList, if WFLG_NW_EXTENDED was used.


IPrefs 45.11 (21.06.2001)

- Uses AHI instead of the audio.device for sound output, if present.


IPrefs 45.12 (28.06.2001)

- Added support for AmigaXL preferences.


IPrefs 45.13 (02.10.2001)

- PDTA_DestMode is now explicitly set to PMODE_V43 for loading 
  backdrop pictures.
