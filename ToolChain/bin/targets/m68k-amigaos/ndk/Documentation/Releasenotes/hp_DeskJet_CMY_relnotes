HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.1 (28.8.99)

- Converted from the CMYK driver sources.

- Put in the special cyan correction for greyscale values. I'm
  not sure how good it is and how well it works. The modern HP
  inkjekt printers apparently do not suffer from the "C+M+Y yields
  a sort of greyisch olive" disease that plagued the early
  consumer devices, such as the HP500C. At least on my test device
  (HP 880C) the greys and the black will shift noticeably into the
  dark magenta if the cyan correction is enabled. I need more
  testing and feedback.


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.2 (29.8.99)

- If printing in black/white or greyscale mode with "Letter" quality
  printing selected, the printing resolution is now quadrupled
  (from 300x300 to 600x600 DPI).


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.3 (2.9.99)

- Recalculated the gamma correction tables. The new tables will
  print brighter, with more contrast.

- Fixed an overrun bug in the compression code.


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.4 (2.9.99)

- Revised the paper and page sizes again; they now reflect
  the sizes given in the official PCL 5 documentation.

- The text top margin is now set to 0 rows (used to be
  2 rows).

- Enabled perforation skip mode for text printing.

- Graphics printing now also sets the page size.

- Printing setup now also allows for paper size A3
  to be used (provided your printer can handle paper
  that large).


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.5 (6.9.99)

- Floyd-Steinberg dithering now alternates the direction
  in which the image data is processed with every line.
  This will result in smoother error distribution and
  improve output quality.


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.6 (6.9.99)

- Now includes information about the functionality
  associated with the density settings and hints
  that tell a querying application that this driver
  cannot mix colour and black/white printing.


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.7 (13.9.99)

- 600 DPI output is no longer tied to the Draft/Letter
  quality settings.


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.8 (13.9.99)

- Now generates all CMY HP DeskJet variants from one common
  source.


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.9 (16.9.99)

- Added locale support.

- Now indicates where the printable page area starts.


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.10 (22.9.99)

- Setting the page size in the raster printing code also
  caused the page to be ejected, causing strip printing
  to break. Fixed.


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.11 (29.9.99)

- Switched over to use "sys/devs.catalog" for its localized
  strings.


HP_DeskJet_CMY 44.12 (24.11.1999)

- Integrated Jochen's page size changes. This should correct
  the problems with the top page margin of the first page
  printed.
