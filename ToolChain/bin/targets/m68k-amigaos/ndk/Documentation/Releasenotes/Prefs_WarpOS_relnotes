WarpOS 45.1 (29.10.2000)

 first version. Nothing more than an interface to set the env-variables
  for the powerpc.library.

WarpOS 45.2 (02.11.2000)

 added a warning information on program start, that this preferences tool
  is only for users who know what they're doing.

 Added option/tooltype USER that can be set to NOVICE, ADVANCED and
  EXPERT. If it is set to ADVANCED or EXPERT, there will be no warning
  information after program start.

WarpOS 45.3 (29.01.2001)

 Fix: Selecting an item from the Edit-menu, when the warning information
  is displayed, corrupted the visual presentation.
