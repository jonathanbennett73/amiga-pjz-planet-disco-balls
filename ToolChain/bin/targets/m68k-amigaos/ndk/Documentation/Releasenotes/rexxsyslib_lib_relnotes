rexxsyslib 44.1 (25.12.1999)

- Modified WaitDOSPkt() to call WaitPort() instead of Wait()'ing
  on the MsgPort's signal. I hope that this is really an improvement.
  The documentation for the WaitDOSPkt() function states its
  purpose as "Waits at the specified message port for a message or
  other signal.". Might be that the side-effect was intentional :-/

- Fixed a long standing bug in the CPU type identification code.
  It no longer mistakenly identifies a machine with an 68040
  CPU as having an "68060" CPU installed. The new code also
  makes a point of identifying an 68882 FPU and an 68060 CPU.
