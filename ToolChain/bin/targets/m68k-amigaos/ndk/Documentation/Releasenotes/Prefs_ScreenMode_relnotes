Screenmode 44.3 (19.7.99)

 A custom width was used for the custom height also.

 Entering a new value into one of the custom gadgets was lost if the
  gadget was activated by clicking on the "Default" checkbox.

 Added tab-cycling for the integer gadgets.

Screenmode 44.4 (31.7.99)

 added stack extension

Screenmode 44.5 (9.8.99)

 added some ICA_TARGET tags

Screenmode 44.7 (18.8.99)

 added close gadget

 added seperator line

 modified Save/Use/Cancel layout

 modified group layout

 number of colors left to slider was not localized and gave wrong values
  for screen depth > 24

퇏for hi and true color screens the depth is set to maximum value and the
  slider is disabled.

Screenmode 44.8 (20.8.99)

 added some code to make selected screenmode visible in list

Screenmode 44.10 (17.9.99)

퇏changed project icon name to def_screenmode_prefs.

 if screen is not 256 pixel height a new autoscroll screen is opened. This
  should allow to use screenmode with all screen settings.

Screenmode 45.1 (20.10.2000)

 added test-environment to test if a screen can be displayed 
  on the monitor.

ScreenMode 45.2 (02.11.2000)

 The countdown on the testscreen now really counts 10 seconds. The 
  UNIT_VBLANK-timer seems not to be accurate enough on some systems.

 Added some more patterns to the testscreen.

 Added option/tooltype USER that can be set to NOVICE, ADVANCED and
  EXPERT. If it is set to ADVANCED or EXPERT, there will be no warning-
  requester if you're using/saving an untested screenmode.

 The testscreen can now be closed by hitting Return or Esc, too.

 Added a warning-requester if the testscreen could not be opened.

ScreenMode 45.3 (13.11.2000)

 Now the four edges of the testscreen are drawn with the SHINEPEN,
  so that they're likely to stand out against the maybe-black border.

ScreenMode 45.4 (20.11.2000)

 By mistake the borders of the readonly info (min/max dimensions...) 
  were forced to "thin" style appearance.

 ScreenMode no longer wants a screen with a height of at least 256 pixels.
  It fits perfectly into a height of 200 pixels.
