version 44.1 (24.4.99)

- Bumped to V44.

- Incorporates the changes for the Version command V40.2.


version 44.2 (6.5.99)

- Retired all the assembly language support code; the new
  code also checks for weird node/resident names.


Version 44.3 (9.9.99)

- Due to a missing termination character, "version <file> full"
  could print junk after the date string.

- The date string is now formatted according to the locale
  selected date format.


Version 44.4 (30.9.99)

- Entering "version <file>" could trap the Version command in an
  endless loop if there was no $VER: tag in the file and the last
  four characters stored in it would begin with a "$" character.
  Quite an obscure bug and one that has always been in there. Fixed.
