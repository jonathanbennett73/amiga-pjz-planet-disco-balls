New MakeDir with ALL keyword and more AmigaOS 3.1-ish behaviour.
----------------------------
revision 45.10
date: 2001/02/27 11:00:56;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;  lines: +5 -6
- now initializes GlobalData structure to avoid silly calling
  OpenCatalog() with random LocaleBase pointer problem. This
  should fix those nasty crashes ;-)
----------------------------
revision 45.9
date: 2001/02/23 16:55:34;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;  lines: +20 -7
- applied early locale startup bug work-around by checking for
  existance for ENV: without showing requester. Thanks to Stephan
  Rupprecht for quick code snippet.
----------------------------
revision 45.8
date: 2001/02/22 09:57:13;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;  lines: +8 -6
- it is safe to pass a NULL pointer to CloseCatalog()
  saved four bytes
----------------------------
revision 45.7
date: 2001/02/22 09:49:20;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;  lines: +43 -13
- localized MakeDir
- changed GlobalData handling, GlobalData is initialized in
  dummy() already: this allows easily passing a pointer
  to it from function to function instead of the whole
  global structure including contents
----------------------------
revision 45.6
date: 2001/02/21 15:46:10;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;  lines: +17 -12
- 20.2.2001: now ignores 202 - object is in use error
----------------------------
revision 45.5
date: 2000/12/30 13:53:10;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -3
- compiled without debug files. Only saved 8 bytes tough.
- still doesn't use "residentable" option in linker settings,
  but still seems to be residentable nicely. Saves another
  8 bytes.
----------------------------
revision 45.4
date: 2000/12/26 23:36:36;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;  lines: +48 -49
- added parsing stuff from Joanne Dow. Thanks Joanne, this
  does it well. Looked at whether its possible to get rid
  of firstchar and prevchar variables but this isn't easy
  and would probably make source quite unreadable
- 700 bytes. Well thats 80 bytes more than the SAS/C
  version from Joanne Dow. But then this one checks for
  WB start (well shouldn't take 80 bytes.)
- Thanks Joanne and Stephan for your help! ;-)
----------------------------
revision 45.3
date: 2000/12/26 22:36:55;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;  lines: +55 -45
- Stephan Rupprecht managed to compile MakeDir 45.2 on his StormC 4
  installation. I got his project file and compared and there were
  some silly compiler settings different. I must have had tomatoes
  on my eyes. My compiler settings were still C++, RTTI and with
  Exceptions. I disabled all of this and then it worked here too.
- Did not use separate options as Stephan Rupprecht did. Here it
  just work with setting small code, small data in the compiler
  settings. And setting residentable program in the linker
  settings.
  (But its 40 Byte more here. Don't understand this one.)
- Compile to 68020
- As Stephan did not uses FindTask to check whether its CLI or
  not and replies WB message itself
  s/not/now ;-)
- Insists on opening dos.library 40.x. Well this is not for
  AmigaOS 2.04 users, but for AmigaOS 3.9 users, so there.
----------------------------
revision 45.2
date: 2000/12/16 10:21:22;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;  lines: +87 -60
- reduced executable size by about 3500 bytes
- uses almost no startup code: noixemul with commandline parser
  and init shared libraries disabled
- uses GeekGadgets GCC since StormC 4 GCC does not work:
  Error: In function 'int MakeDir(char *, GlobalData, long int)':
  parse error before '__asm'
  MakeDir.c, line 43
  [ ... some more errors like that ... ]
  Error: In function 'int MakeDir(char *, GlobalData, long int)':
  confused by earlier errors, bailing out
  MakeDir.c, line 47
  So what? When StormGCC decides to be confused I simply use the
  GeekGadgets gcc
- noixemul startup code gives easy access to WBenchMsg. So I check
  for it to prevent crashes when run from Workbench. Just click on
  the supplied icon.
- should already be able to work without any startup code: I just
  don't know how to tell GCC from GG to link without any startup
  code and did not look on how to access WBenchMsg then.
- Thanks to Stephan Rupprecht for the gcc code example, Joanne Dow
  for her SAS/C example and Michael Christoph and Thomas Richter
  for their help.
- so now the notes are longer than the program itself ;-)
----------------------------
revision 45.1
date: 2000/12/16 09:00:44;  author: Helios;  state: Exp;
- First AmigaOS 3.9 version. Implemented "ALL" keyword.
- using PrintFault() everywhere where applicable.
- using ReadArgs().
