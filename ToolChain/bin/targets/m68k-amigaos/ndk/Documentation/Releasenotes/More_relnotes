more 44.1 (15.7.99)

- Bumped to V44.

- Removed the copyright text.


more 44.2 (17.7.99)

- Resizing the output window now also refreshes the display.

- Clicking on the window close gadget now terminates the program.
  This used to work only with the built-in CON: handler and relied
  upon an implementation defined side-effect. It now correctly
  requests that the console driver returns window resize and
  window close events.


more 44.3 (6.8.99)

- Removed the close gadget/resize control codes altogether.
  This fixes the standard CON:, but doesn't fix WShell's
  display handler. Bummer.

-------- start thor's log--------------

more 44.5 (22.10.2000)

- Recompiled with registerized parameters as much as possible.
- more requires now Os 2.04 or better. No chance to run this
  under 1.2 anymore. This is really really really obsolete.
- more uses now the utility library for "uppercase" conversion,
  removed the "roll your own" routine. This requires a new
  catalog for more.
- more did not close the libraries correctly on emergency exit,
  fixed.
- more did not release the console window information, broke
  ViNCEd iconification. Fixed.
- Removed obsolete sendpkt() code and replaced by SetMode().
- Fixed various incorrect parameters to SetMode(). RAW mode
  is engaged by 1L, not DOSTRUE. The argument to SetMode()
  is the "startup" parameter of the console, not a TRUE/FALSE
  indicator. Who hasn't read the docs here, Carolyn? (-;
- Removed Amiga.lib fgetc() since it is broken. It sign-
  extends 8 bit ANSI characters, which is nonsense, especially
  if you want to check for EOF.
- found olsen's close/resize notification fixes are correct, so
  is the WShell. What is broken here is CON: Won't fix it
  since ViNCEd contains a workaround anyhow. *sigh*
- removed half a duzend of console hacks from "More". It used
  to peek and poke in the ConUnit structure. *Shudder*
  More uses now proper CSI sequences to obtain the window size
  and the cursor position, including fall-back code if the one
  or the other is not available. The fall-back code is smart
  enough to run on VT-xxx terminals. See the ViNCEd includes
  about the sources. Yes, this is CON: compatible, for sure.
  No, the code won't deadlock in case no answer is received.
- Removed the ugly "dummy ConUnit" more required to work on
  AUX: terminals. This improves the quality of "more" by about
  ten points.
- Added a fix to avoid the horizontal flickering of "more" on
  long lines when using ViNCEd. This is compatible to CON:,
  so don't worry.
- Removed a strange and wonderful bug that could have created
  bogus characters on the screen if overlong lines are broken.
  This bug must have been ages old.
- Run tests to confirm that more continues working over an AUX:
  terminal. Yup, it does. It accepts Amiga CON:, extended CON:
  (ViNCEd) and VT-100 or better terminals. In case more cannot
  detect the window size, it will format the screen according
  to a 80x24 window size. 
- Removed a couple of now pretty useless hard-coded checks for
  the AUX: handler.
- Fixed "scroll half screen down" command alt+space. This must
  have been broken for ages.
- Fixed "scroll down one line" option. Refused to work if the
  console size changed without inquiring "More". This should
  be better now.
- Added "g" as command to jump to the be*g*inning of the buffer.
  This is just my pecularity because I'm used to "less".

BUGS:

- Should have bumped the revision to 45.1. Too much changed.
  In fact, this more is much more than more used to be, and
  more changed this time more than more changed in the last 
  decade. More chances to add more mores in this paragraph?

TODO:

- Highliting of "search" results would be nice.
- Replace the ancient startup code, remove ugly Amiga.lib
  stub routines, recompile with "NEAR DATA". Oh well...

more 45.1 (26.10.2000)

- Fixed the bug above and bumped the revision to 45.1
- Note that the catalog has changed slightly. Please re-
  translate or update Utilities.cd

more 45.2 (4.11.2000)

- Found that more interprets ?foobar also as help request.
  Fixed to accept only a single question mark for this 
  purpose.
- More could have looped infinitely in case a backsearch
  within a pipe was tried. It now bails out if it detects
  that seeking does not move the file pointer anymore.
- Was completely unlucky to reproduce a potential problem
  with pipes which could possibly yield to situations where
  "more" doesn't close its IO handles. This, at least,
  looks fine. Somehow.

more 45.3 (24.11.2000)

- More opened the wrong catalog.

more 45.4 (26.11.2000)

- When more prompted for a file name, it did not run the
  result code thru the dos ReadArgs() parser, but used
  to use it directly. Hence, trailing spaces would have been
  part of the file name. More 45.4 ignores now trailing
  spaces, but it still does not parse quotes or asterisks
  (escape characters) correctly. This requires serious
  reconsideration, more than I could fix now.

more 45.5 (26.11.2000)

- Ok, I reconsidered this. More uses now the proper DOS
  argument parser for file names. Wasn't as hard as I thought,
  so this should work. Shell argument parsing is, however,
  still old and requires some thought. Nothing I want to
  do right now.

more 45.6 (13.12.2000)

- More 45.5 broke reading the argument from the shell completely.
  This was due to a missing '\n' for ReadArgs. Fixed.

- Forgot to bump the release to 45.6. Fixed.
