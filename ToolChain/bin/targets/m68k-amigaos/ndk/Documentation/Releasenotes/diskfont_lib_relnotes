diskfont 44.1 (1.5.99)

- Bumped to V44.

- Recompiled with SAS/C 6.58

- Converted to use registerized parameters
  throughout the library, inlined static
  functions, no longer uses A4 to reference
  data.

- Replaced the code that queries the global
  environment variable "diskfont". It now
  uses dos.library routines to read the
  variable rather than reading all the
  data on its own.

- The extended library function (offset -24) now
  returns NULL.


diskfont 44.2 (7.9.99)

- Replaced the roll-your-own case-insensitive string
  comparison code with Stricmp().

- Improved handling of soft linked objects. Their type,
  size and protection bits are now resolved, if possible.
