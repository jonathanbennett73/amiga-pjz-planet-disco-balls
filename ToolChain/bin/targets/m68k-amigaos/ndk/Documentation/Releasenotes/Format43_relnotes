workbench/system/format

    Used to wait idle for 30 seconds on formatting bad disks.
    Froze 43.1.
    Should now handle NSD FFS disks >4GB and block sizes >512 bytes
    if the handler does not support ACTION_FORMAT. The latter is
    pretty useless these days but included for completeness.
    Format is always waiting for a validated disk after the final
    Inhibit(FALSE). This wait can now be aborted with CTRL-C.
    Froze 43.2.
    The root block definition was not ok. This is a cosmetic source
    change for future compatibility.
    Froze 43.3.
    Calculation for disksize was incorrect and showed 0.
    Froze 43.4.
