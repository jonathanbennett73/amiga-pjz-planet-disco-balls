Exchange 44.4 (7.8.99)

-  Corrected domain layout issue which would cause the information group to
   overwrite the right window border.

-  Corrected startup issue. Cx would notify that the arexx port could not be
   created but yet would not cause the Cx if running to show itself.

Exchange 44.5 (10.8.99)

-  Corrected issue where the Cx would not remove itself.

Exchange 44.6 (11.8.99)

-  Tracked down and corrected multiple refresh issue. (Mario P.)
   What was happening is that the window normally refreshes it's damaged
   area (normal happenings) but, being a Cx it was also receiving a
   CXM_COMMAND/CXCMD_LIST_CHG (don't ask me to explain why because I really
   don't know..the Cx list hadn't changed) which was causing the 2nd refresh.

-  Properly displays the selected LB item (if one was selected prior to closing
   the window) will be shown.

Exchange 44.7 (18.8.99)

-  Removed window height lock

-  changed appicon call to v44 icon.library function call

-  Added 40 char domain to information display.

-  If an item is selected from the LB that is the same as the current one
   there will be no refresh of the display.

Exchange 44.8 (20.8.99)

-  Removed LB bevel group and label and replaced with LB ColumnTitle

-  Removed Information bevel group text to close up the information group
   and moved that text to it's own label above.

Exchange 44.9 (26.8.99)

-  Reduced the information domain by 5 chars. Seems to be an issue with
   button.gadget and non-prop fonts whereas prop fonts work as described,
   passed on relevant info to c.aldi

-  Window now opens at bottom of screen titlebar.

-  Fixed trouble where the listbrowser wasn't updating when commodities were
   added or removed while the window was open.  Problem now is that MagicMenu
   now continues to cause a refresh again (see rev .6 notes).  I'm at my wits
   end with MagicMenu and whatever "magic" it's doing to the Cx list and why.

Exchange 44.10 (10.9.99)

- Added new tag for handling columninfo in the LB properly.
