--- OS 3.5 release ---

Format 44.14 (7.12.99)

- rework

- Starting format with more than one WB parameter now correctly closes all
  windows. This is a ugly hack: the main window is closed and reopened between
  formatting two devices. Too much work to make it nicer (Did you recognize
  that selecting two icons from WB and using menu Icon/Format Disk starts
  Format two times?)

- Removed broken handling of inserting/removing disk while main window is open.

Format 44.15 (21.12.99)

- Format now writes a Disk.info icon if started from WB or if CLI option 
  NOICONS is omitted.
