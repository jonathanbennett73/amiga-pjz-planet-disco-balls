IoTools 45.1:

- This is the first release of IoTools.


IoTools 45.2:

- IoTools was said to hang on insertion of
  non-mountable disks for Ralph Schmidt devices.
  Cannot reproduce it here on the GVP. My guess is
  that this is related to Ralph's design
  concerning the mounting of handlers by his
  device. I'm now trying to work around this as 
  best as possible.
- IoTools uses now a separate string in case
  an incompatible medium was found on formatting.
- Note that due to the change above the catalog
  grew and one new string has to be translated.
  Sorry to the translators...


IoTools 45.3:

- Filing sytstem format tend to fail with "no disk
  inserted" after a low level format on P5
  devices. My guess is that it doesn't allow access
  to a disk which does "obviously not belong" to this
  filing system since it lacks an RDB and a proper
  disk structure. I try now to work around this by
  a longer wait period and by trying the high level
  format several times. This should hopefully fix
  this.
- IoTools ghost now the format and cancel buttons on
  a format. Note that you cannot stop a running
  SCSI low-level format, so there is no possibility
  to add a "Cancel" or "Abort" button, sorry.
- IoTools selects now "FFS Intl" as default filing
  system in case the disk is not yet formatted.
- Fixed the incorrect version string.
- IoTools does currently not support ATAPI/IDE ZIPs
  and JAZs. This has little to do with my lazyness,
  its more due to the lack of a system standard how
  to issue vendor specific commands over an IDE
  interface, hence I'm "out" here, I afraid. IoTools
  try now harder to detect such a device and to avoid
  offering to send commands to such a beast.
  Send me documentation how to program IDE interfaces
  and I reconsider.


IoTools 45.4:

- The minutes display for the drive spindown is now 
  localizable.

IoTools 45.5:

- Fixed two typos in the localization.

IoTools 45.6:

- Added an additional safety layer around the DOS device
scanning including the "bad device list". Removed the
"trackdisk.device" from this list since some third party
hardware I do not remember mounts the ZIP or JAZ as
trackdisk.device unit 4. 

IoTools 45.7:

- The SCSI "disk valid" check came too few for some devices 
causing in a "disk ready" even if the cartridge has been 
ejected just a second before. Added an "EjectDelay" around 
the device inquiry as workaround.
