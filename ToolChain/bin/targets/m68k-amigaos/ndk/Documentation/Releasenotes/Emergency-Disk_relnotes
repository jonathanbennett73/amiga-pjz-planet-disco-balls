Pre-RCS releasenotes:
=====================

44.2 (22.6.1999)
- ENVARC: on floppy disk

44.3 (22.6.1999)
- now really boots from CD instead of harddisk
- replaced occurences of "DF0:" by ":"

44.4 (23.6.1999) Jürgen Haage
- replaced CD0: by AmigaOS3.5:

44.5 (27.9.1999) André "Quasselstrippe" Dörffler
- now assigning SYS: to CD lately to get access to SYS:Prefs/Presets right

44.6 (9.10.1999) Martin 'Helios' Steigerwald
- 44.5 does not work! ;-(((( Was it tested?
  Startup-Sequence on CD-ROM will not work correctly when the SYS:
  assign does not point to the Emergency-Disk on CD-ROM. For example
  the Assign Libs: SYS:Classes ADD tries to assign to floppy disk then.
  Guess what happens. ReAction classes can not be accessed anymore.
  Now SYS: points to CD-ROM again.
- To get Emergency-Boot and CyberGraphX V3 / V4 happy (SYS:Prefs/Presets)
  I now did a "Assign SYS: DF0: ADD" just before execution of CD-ROM
  Startup-Sequence. Didn't think that this works, but it does.
- Removed RemLibrary commands.
- Assign is made resident now... might be a little bit faster.
- Removed dependency to DF0: again.
  SYS: --> emergency disk assign will be removed after execution
  of CD-ROM Startup-Sequence.
  Needs temporary EDISK: assign.
- When there is a User-Startup on Emergency-Disk it will be executed.
- Does not remove EDISK:-assign anymore, might be useful to someone.
- Made an example User-Startup with some comments.
- Have fun ;-)

44.7 (12.10.1999)
- Hmm, my 44.5 was not the newest one. Andre already detected the bug
  in it and wrote a 44.6.
  But my 44.6 (now 44.7) should also be able to fix that problem with
  the Locale: assign. Andre just adds a LIBS: Classes add assign to the
  Startup-Sequence on the disk.
  Making SYS: point to CD-ROM and after this to disk is safer. Cause then
  the Locale: assign would have been right in the first place
  Thus bumped revision to 44.7 to avoid version conflicts. This version
  will now be used and it fixes the Locale: assign and maybe other issues
  still have been around when SYS: is not on CD-ROM.

44.8 (18.11.2000)
- Changes made by Juergen
- most notably IDEFix support for Emergency Disk

45.1 (18.1.2001)
- changes by me, Martin
- When IDEFix is in Emergency-Disk:C start "AmigaOS ROM Update"
  with SKIPROMUPDATES "scsi.device"
- leave EDISK: assign
- make EBOOT: assign: EDISK: and EBOOT: allow easy referencing
  the Emergency-Boot on CD-ROM and the Emergency-Disk
