IconEdit 44.2 (15.7.99)

 Initial release

 Known Bugs, ToDo and outstanding Tests:

	 Bug: Remove 2nd Chunky Image (Type Darken), bug in icon.library
	
	 Bug: shortcuts do not work (window class problem)
	
	 ToDo: Create full set of usefull templates
	
	 ToDo: Make more actions undoable (Paste, Load Image, Restore)
	
	 ToDo: Warning before Glow Effect (TransPen must be 0)
	
	 Test: Save Settings
	
	 Test: WB Start
	
	 ToDo: Better default palette (hand made for glow icons)
	
	 ToDo: replace chooser with popcycle
	
	 ToDo: very slow on hi/true color screens

 some docu hints:

	 select background color with SHIFT-Palette
	
	 "Glow" is not perfect: the transparent pen must be pen 0
	
	 only the two drawing colors are hold in exclusive obtained pens,
	  all other pens from the palette use shared pens. Thus the color of 
	  a pen may change if you select or unselect it.
	
	 "Template" loads the images from a template icon. You can set the
	  path with Tooltype "TEMPLATE". The type of the Icon is added to
	  the path name before loading. The type suffixes are: "_Disk",
	  "_Drawer", "_Tool", "_Project", "_Garbage". Of course a ".info"
	  suffix is removed from the template path before adding the type
	  suffix ("SYS:Storage/Icons/template.info" -> 
	  "SYS:Storage/Icons/template_Tool")
	
	 If settings "Save optimized" is set, save optimizes the icon palette
	  before saving the icon. Unused colors are removed.
	
	 Currently you must convert a NewIcon to OS 3.5 icon before changes
	  to such an icon are visible. It is not possible to edit "NewIcons".
	  This is a limitation of icon.library.

IconEdit 44.3 (20.7.99)

 IconEdit crashed if running under native AmigaOS graphics (no Picasso96
patches installed). Fixed two OS calls with wrong parameters.

 Some internal changes to make IconEdit more stable in unusal cases (very
very large images etc)

 Highlight type for old icon was handled wrong so "Save" failed most times.

IconEdit 44.4 (29.7.99)

 Renamed Menu Extras/Glow to Extras/Add Glow

 User Requesters because of changed images etc have no a title "IconEdit"
  instead of "Program Error" whivch is used for I/O errors etc.
  
 Glow Effect is undoable.

 Glow Effect changes palette colors: all colors are darken and three colors
  (white, yellow, bright orange) are added if not already in palette with
  good quality.

 Click on Radio Button without changing selection will not longer make IE
  busy for some secondes.

 Fixed one bug in Glow Effect. This seems to fix the problem of randomly
  changed pixels.

 Maximum magnify is now 8 (was 16).

 Large images with large magnification needs too much chip mem
  (256 * 256 * 8 * 8 bytes == 4 MB for display bit map). If the display
  bitmap cannot be allocated the magnifying is reduced by one and the
  allocation is tried again.

 Some memory was not freed at program exit.

 Added busy-mouse for many commands (changing image size etc)

 Extras/Minimize Sketchboard is now limited to 16x16

 Extras/#? Sketchboard is now dis/enabled depended on size of sketchboard.

 Dropping icons from workbench now works

 If both the normal and selected image of the new image type is empty the
  saved icon contains no chunky images, so icoin.library will show the old
  icon images instead (empty) chunky images.

 loading a volume or drawer not longer results in an error message: a
  volume name (Work:) automatically gets "Disk" appended (Work:Disk) and
  a drawer path gets an enevtually slash cut (ram:T/ -> ram:T).

 fixed a bug throwing enforcerhits while copying image to clipboard.

 fixed a bug with shrinking magnifying while scroller is not at the leftmost
  (or topmost) position

 modifying the selected image automatically changes highlighting mode to
  "Image"
  
 drawing a single pixel with coninious-drawing tool did not work

 color sliders updates without flicker

 palette updates could reduce flickering on true color screens if palette
  gadget would handling better.

IconEdit 44.5 (9.8.99)

 fixed a badly initialised temp rastport on hi/true color screens

IconEdit 44.6 (11.8.99)

퇏restricted gradientslider to 6 exclusive pens

IconEdit 44.7 (13.8.99)

 the bug fix in 44.5 was not a bug fix but just another way to make it wrong.

IconEdit 44.8 (14.8.99)

 "Restore" Images were not released at "New", "Open", "Quit". Especially
  chip memory were wasted.

 If one loads an icon without new image the old images are shown 
  automatically. This may not work because of loading default icons 
  if a file has no icon.

 Label "HSB:" missed the colon

 Overwriting an icon (Save As...) now notifies the user

 Added a warning if a NewIcon is loaded because saving it will drop the
  NewIcon tooltypes and create a pen mapped icon.

 removed that blue box behind tool buttons

 mutual exclude menu items (type, highlight, colormodel) were not marked
  as such

 moved pattern, tool and scroll buttons above demo pads. Now all important
  buttons (image selector, tool buttons, palette) and most less important
  (magnifier, patterns, tranparent button) are at the top of window. Should
  shorten the mouse moves.

IconEdit 44.9 (14.9.99)

퇏a new icon.library and a small change in IconEdit fixes the problem of
  not saveing old images.

 Tooltype USEGRID was not copied to the sketchboard at startup.

 Paste didn't work due to wrong datatypes usage.

 Clicking in the upper demopad only shows the selected image if the highlight
  type is "Image". Emulating the 3 other highlighting modes is too difficult
  (especially "Darken").

 Pressing the magnifier gadgets very fast disabled the gadget before it was
  deselected. Fixed.

 File Requester for open/save icons not longer shows only .info files but
  uses a editable pattern #?.info to show icon files only.

 IconEdito is now a lot faster on Hi/True Color screens.

 IconEdit uses Matts interface glyphs

 RGB sliders use now values from 0 to 255 instead of hardware value range

IconEdit 44.10 (21.9.99)

 If IconEdit's window was large minimizing it trashed the border window: the
  mouse coordinate output was updated before the new layout was calulated.

IconEdit 44.11 (23.9.99)

 Error message from "New" operation was to simple. Not every error is an
  "Out of memory" error.

 If filename for saving icon is too long a error message is displayed. 
  Untested, because icon.library which supports this is not released yet.

 IconEdit should now work without Workbench running.

IconEdit 44.12 (28.9.99)

 Fixed another bug for hi/true color screens: creating the colormap for an
  icon illegal color register number were used.

IconEdit 44.13 (28.9.99)

 Removed useless error message when canceling file requester in 
  "Save Clip As..."

IconEdit 44.14 (30.9.99)

 Re-save of resource file with new ReActor version fixes the bug not disposing
  all BOOPSI objects on quit.

IconEdit 44.15 (30.9.99)

 added a work-around in "Open Clip..." for a behaviour of picture.datatype
  that I call a bug...

--- OS 3.5 release ---

IconEdit 44.16 (28.10.99)

 changing a color on hi/true color screens didn't update the sketchboard

 close gadget didn't ask user if icon was modified.

 fixed clipping in GM_RENDER method

IconEdit 44.17 (18.11.99)

 Canceling of Loading NewIcons on program startup now loads the default tool
  icon.
  
 Iconify/Deiconify no longer mess the drop zones.

 alternate old icon image was not cleared on save (thrash in image if 
  alternate image was smaller than the normal image)

 Added workaround for WriteChunkyPixel() on CD32 with faster CPU - hardware
  conversion seems not to work anymore.

IconEdit 44.18 (29.11.99)

 Window position and size is now stored and restored.

IconEdit 44.19 (2.12.99)

 Loaded images (clipboard or files) are now remapped to max 256 colors.
