AsyncWB 45.0 (27.11.00)

- first beta release.


AsyncWB 45.1 (28.11.00)

- (hopefully) fixed some enforcer hits that were reported by Mario.
  I couldn't reproduce it here but I found the place where the program
  could have thrown them.

 
AsyncWB 45.2 (01.12.00)

- starting the program a 2nd time terminates it.

- can be started from wb, now.


AsyncWB 45.3 (07.12.00)

- all texts except "Create Icon?" (New Drawer function) are localized, now.
  the workbench.catalog is used for that <Mario Cattaneo>.

- the makedir function can create several drawers at once, now. For example:
  1/2/3 creates drawer 1 and 2 in 1 and 3 in 2 in 1 :) <Mario Cattaneo>.

- a few internal changes.


AsyncWB 45.4 (15.12.00)

- pressing tab doesn't terminate the textinput requester any longer <Mario Cattaneo>.

- the "Create Icon?" text is now localized (the Q_ICON_MENU label is used).

- displays the greeting text (the text above the string.gadget of a textinput
  request), now.

- for rename and new drawer the contents of the string.gadget will be marked.

- when renaming/creating an iconless file/drawer, the contents of the parent
  drawer will be updated via "wbarexx/MENU WINDOW.UPDATE".


AsyncWB 45.5 (16.12.00)

- when renaming an object *with* an icon, the icon was removed from the display
  without adding it to the display again. Bug was introduced in 45.4. 

- replacing a drawer failed when the window of the drawer to replace was open
  <Eike M. Lang>.

- when replacing an object its icon won't be overwritten anymore <also Eike>.


AsyncWB 45.6 (27.12.00)

- even for large drawers, the copy/delete progress window should appear after
  2-3 secs.

- copying a disk should (correctly) duplicate its icon, now. when the disk
  to be copied doesn't have an icon the default drawer icon will be used
  (before def_disk was used) <Mario Cattaneo>.
  
- fixed byte-write to #0 enforcer hit when sending arexx commands to wb <Mario>.

- AllegroCDFS returns ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND when trying to read beyond the
  end of a file, the filesystem should simply return zero for this case. AsyncWB
  takes care of this problem, now.

- the prompt of a textinput requester is now always marked <Mario Cattaneo>.

- when a textinput requester went inactive, its string.gadget will be activated
  again when the window becomes the active one, again <also Mario>. Don't know
  whether the text should be marked again in this case.

- rename doesn't put up an error requester any longer when the icon to rename
  doesn't have a corresponding file or drawer <Andrea Vallinotto>.
  
- the button of the greeting message (the text above the string.gadget) didn't
  have underscoring disabled <also Andrea>.


AsyncWB 45.7 (31.12.00)

- when copying an iconless file or drawer, the destination drawer will be 
  rescanned to update the display. That's not a perfect solution but the
  best I can do for now (before an icon was created to update the display).
  Don't like to create an icon and deleting it immediately ...

- deleting only icons (icons without a corresponding file or drawer) didn't
  work because I forgot to set a variable back to NULL <Vit Sindlar>.


AsyncWB 45.8 (12.01.01)

- when updating a drawer (after copying something) the program (actually wb)
  could throw some enforcer hits because of a flag that wasn't cleared
  <Vit Sindlar>. Thanks to David Rey and Mario Cattaneo for reproducing the
  bug.


AsyncWB 45.9 (17.01.01)
  
- improved (soft)link support, possibly not perfect but the best I could do
  <Francis Labrie>.


AsyncWB 45.10 (24.01.01)

- this version should really fix what 45.8 should have fixed ;)


AsyncWB 45.11 (13.02.01)

- no longer rescans the drawer when changing/copying an iconless file
  in a "show all files" drawer, UpdateWorkbench() will be used to 
  update the display, now. Requires at least workbench.library 45.121!

- no longer leaves filehandles open when skipping files that already
  exist on the destination.

- misc changes and fixes not really worth to mention :)


AsyncWB 45.12 (19.02.01)

- deleting a drawerless drawer icon didn't work.

- makedirs also works when the mother drawer is in use <Mario Cattaneo>.


AsyncWB 45.13 (13.03.01)

- integrated Joanne Dow's makedir magic <Mario Cattaneo>.

- too sad it's not Friday ;)


AsyncWB 45.14 (17.03.01)

- when the source does not have an icon but the destination, the program no
  longer puts up the "Replace/Skip/Abort" requester <Mario Cattaneo>.


AsyncWB 45.15 (06.04.01)

- now really handles "Skip All/Replace All" of .info files correctly.

- AsyncWB no longer spawns new processes for the rename/relabel operation,
  this way there will be only one rename window at a time.

- rename reselects the icon after renaming it, this is what wb does.


AsyncWB 45.16 (18.04.01)

- rename or new drawer no longer overwrite the command cache of the execute
  command function.

- holding down RAMIGA when clicking on the "Cancel" button (or closegadget) 
  of a rename window, will also cancel all queued rename requests.
  
- selecting a button of an inactive window won't be aborted any longer.

- the delete progress window shouldn't come up too early, now.


AsyncWB 45.17 (10.06.01)

- now clones the filedate <Mario Cattaneo>.
 
- makedir complains about already existing dirs, now <Mario>.

- some new code in 45.16 caused the delete/copy to abort when
  the user clicked on the progress window <also Mario>.


AsyncWB 45.18 (18.06.01)

- Forgot to remove some debugging output <Mario Cattaneo>.

- the rename and newdrawer function allows to enter all wildcards, now
  <David Rey>.


AsyncWB 45.19 (15.08.01)

- Now keeps the filename uptodate (lower-/uppercase) when replacing files.


AsyncWB 45.20 (19.09.01)

- pressing Esc in a string.gadget cancels the requester, now.


AsyncWB 45.21 (25.10.01)

- added NOASYNC as an attempt to reduce CPU usage a bit on IDE
  based systems.
  
- you can drop icons on the "Execute Command" window, now.

- also added a simple history function (use cursor up/dn keys) to the 
  window.

- when entering an URL the program will attempt to open it in a 
  browser (requires openurl package from the Aminet).

- entering a path to a drawer opens the window of the drawer.


AsyncWB 45.22 (16.12.01)

- makedir accepts '/', again <David Rey>.
