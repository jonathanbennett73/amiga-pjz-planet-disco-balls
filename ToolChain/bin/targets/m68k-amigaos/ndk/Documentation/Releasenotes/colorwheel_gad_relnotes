colorwheel.gadget 45.0 (27.10.00)

- the maximum number of pens the gadget will try to allocate
  can be specified via an enviroment variable, now.
  The variable is called "classes/gadgets/cw_maxpens", it can
  be set to either 7,19,37,61 or 91 pens (you can set it to
  other values, but only the listed ones make sense).


colorwheel.gadget 45.1 (31.10.00)

- integrated some code of the original colorwheel. the reason
  for doing this was to test whether this gives a speed increase.
  unfortunately, it didn't :( because H&P would like to avoid
  the .060 version of the gadget, I did not undo the changes.
  please note that this new (old) code doesn't work well for
  elliptical shapes. It's now upto the betatester to "kick out"
  the code, or not ...


colorwheel.gadget 45.2 (10.11.00)

- the border of the wheel is now drawn using graphics.library/
  AreaEllipse(). This looks slightly better and fixes the problem
  that the mask used for transparent blitting did not had exactly
  the same shape as the wheel itself.
  
- uses AllocRaster() to allocated memory for the mask and ghosted
  pattern, again. In the past I had some problems with that but it
  seems to be fixed, now. At least I hope so ... ;)


colorwheel.gadget 45.3 (15.11.00)

- I must have been mentally absent when I wrote the GM_DOMAIN 
  method. It threw some enforcer hits as it was expecting 
  that gpd_GInfo->gi_DrInfo is != NULL.


colorwheel.gadget 45.4 (20.11.00)

- increased the minimum width to 75 and the nominal width to 100 
  pixels, the height is (still) scaled based on the aspect ratio
  <Sebastian Bauer>.


colorwheel.gadget 45.5 (21.11.00)

- Changing the disabled state of the gadget didn't force a complete
  redraw.
  

colorwheel.gadget 45.6 (20.02.01)

- there was a slight chance that notification didn't work due
  to an uninitialized variable.


colorwheel.gadget 45.7 (27.03.01)

- the gadget is now a fat-binary including PPC support for WarpUP.


colorwheel.gadget 45.8 (28.03.01)

- just found out that something got broken after 44.7 (yes, 44), 
  so that the knob wasn't erased correctly in a MUI layout when
  the user has resized the window.
  
- replaced 68k sqrt() routine through a slightly faster one.
