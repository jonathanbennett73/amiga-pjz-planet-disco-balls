IPatch 45.1 (18.11.2000)

 initial release

 Thanks to Massimo Tantignone (betatester and author of VisualPrefs): without
  him this program could not be finished in time. Great work!

 IPatch makes the size gadget and border gadgets larger (height of size
  gadget is increased from 10 pixels to 14). Lower window border is set
  to 3 pixels (1 pixel fillpen between shine and shadow). This matches
  4:3 screen resolutions as good as possible.

 This is only a betatest program. We will integrate it into IPrefs and add
  an option to IControl to switch it on/off. Currently activate it by settings
  arg ACTIVE on startup or press Ctrl-D to toggle active/inactive state.

 For first testing you don't have to put it into your startup-sequence. Just
  run it from CLI. Screen opened after activting it should use the larger
  size gadget, screens that were opened before shouldn't. Please test this
  carefully. Force a workbench reset (change screen font or similar) to see
  if activating / inactivating it on Workbench do work.

 Now please run it from your startup-sequence BEFORE IPrefs. Set arg
  ACTIVE if you want to start it active.

  RUN >NIL: <NIL: IPatch ACTIVE

 After integrating it into IPrefs it will reset the Workbench screen

 For testing: Please try it together with other window border enhancers
  (VisualPrefs, MCP, SysIHack (some might still use it)). Test what happens
  if it is started before or after the patches. What happens after
  activating / inactivating it? I expect no really bad results with 
  VisualPrefs but I am not sure about MCP and SysIHack.

 I am not sure about its quality for lowres screens. Typically AmigaOS
  knows two different sizes for window border: LOWRES and MEDRES. LOWRES
  is a small (mostly) 1:1 resolution and MEDRES is (mostly) 2:1. We only
  changed the MEDRES resolutions (now 4:3) which is used for all Non-LoRes
  screens. But it is possible that the patches do not work perfectly with
  LowRes screens. Please test this carefully.
