ClassAct 44.1 (17.8.99)

· This is a starter program for Reaction prefs tool. If started from CLI
  it starts Reaction. If started from WB it opens an unlocalized Requester
  which tells the user to use Reaction instead of ClassAct to edit
  preferences. 
  
  This program should be installed in SYS:Prefs and replaces the old 
  ClassAct prefs program. An existing icon should be deleted while 
  installing.
