HP_LaserJet 44.1 (31.7.99)

- Ported to SAS/C


HP_LaserJet 44.2 (1.8.99)

- Retired the "roll your own" numeric conversion code.


HP_LaserJet 44.3 (1.8.99)

- 8-bit-per-gun raster printing works.

- Implemented custom dithering code for ordered dithering
  (Bayer matrix), halftone dithering (45° 8x8 screen)
  and Floyd-Steinberg dithering (standard filter with
  four weights on standard raster). The 8x8 screen was
  chosen since it represents a reasonable compromise between
  resolution tradeoffs and the number of colours it can
  display.

- Cleaned up the rendering and the transfer code. Retired
  all unused variables.


HP_LaserJet 44.4 (6.8.99)

- The driver didn't initialize its data structures properly,
  leading to no end of trouble. Fixed.


HP_LaserJet 44.5 (7.8.99)

- Converted to use the small data model.

- Clarified the documentation and implementation of the
  dithering code.

- Rewrote the Floyd-Steinberg code to use 16 bit wide dithering
  tables. This saves space and time. 32 bits would have done the
  job, but are not really necessary.


HP_LaserJet 44.6 (21.8.99)

- Rewrote the density, that is, the page size calculation code.
  The new implementation should be quite a bit clearer than
  David Berezowski's original code.

- Now allows for 600 DPI graphics printing with densities
  5, 6 and 7. Note that this requires a PCL 5e compliant
  printer, such as the LaserJet 4.


HP_LaserJet 44.7 (21.8.99)

- Implemented method #2 raster data compression (TIFF packbits)
  after experimenting with methods #1 and #3 to find out which
  one would yield the best results. Compression will be used
  only in 600 DPI mode. And it really needs it.

  Question: will the driver continue to work with the LaserJet+,
  LaserJetII and other antique hardware?


HP_LaserJet 44.8 (22.8.99)

- Rewrote, simplified and clarified "dospecial.c". Also took
  the opportunity to review the number of lines supposed to
  be printable on a page. For A4 sized paper, the original
  number of lines was too large by five lines. Also, the US
  paper sizes couldn't have possibly allowed for more lines
  of text to be printed than the imageable area of the printer
  permits.

- The code that selects the printer density no longer allows
  paper sizes A0-A3 to be used as no LaserJet printer supported
  by this driver can handle paper sizes that large.

- The code conversion function now tracks whether alphanumeric
  data has been written to the printer.


HP_LaserJet 44.9 (22.8.99)

- Now selects ISO 8859-1 as the primary font encoding. This will
  finally allow all text characters to be printed the way they were
  intended to.

  Question: will this still work with the LaserJet+, LaserJetII
  and other antique hardware?


HP_LaserJet 44.10 (22.8.99)

- Now also sets the page format when setting the page size.


HP_LaserJet 44.11 (27.8.99)

- Page size setup was somewhat broken. Removed the "set page length"
  command and kept only the "set page format" command.

- Corrected the A4 page size limits again.


HP_LaserJet 44.12 (27.8.99)

- Replaced the compression method #2 code with public domain code.

- Reorganized the source code.

- Compression is now enabled by default. This effectively makes this
  driver incompatible with the LaserJet II and LaserJet+ for which
  this driver was originally written. The first LaserJet model this
  driver will work with is the LaserJet IIP, which was introduced
  before 1990.


HP_LaserJet 44.13 (27.8.99)

- Cleaned up the dithering code again in preparation for the
  colour printing enhancements.


HP_LaserJet 44.14 (27.8.99)

- Yet more cleanup work in the dithering department...


HP_LaserJet 44.15 (28.8.99)

- Merged the changes made in the CMYK driver back into the
  B/W driver code. This includes, for example, improved data
  compression. The new compression code will make sure that
  the amount of data to be sent to the printer does not grow
  with compression.


HP_LaserJet 44.16 (2.9.99)

- Fixed an overrun bug in the compression code.


HP_LaserJet 44.17 (2.9.99)

- Revised the paper and page sizes again; they now reflect
  the sizes given in the official PCL 5 documentation.

- The text top margin is now set to 0 rows (used to be
  2 rows).

- Enabled perforation skip mode for text printing.

- Graphics printing now also sets the page size.

- Printing setup now also allows for paper size A3
  to be used (provided your printer can handle paper
  that large).


HP_LaserJet 44.18 (6.9.99)

- Floyd-Steinberg dithering now alternates the direction
  in which the image data is processed with every line.
  This will result in smoother error distribution and
  improve output quality.


HP_LaserJet 44.19 (13.9.99)

- Now supports 1200 DPI output for the LaserJet 2100/4000/5000/8000.


HP_LaserJet 44.20 (13.9.99)

- Now generates all HP LaserJet variants from one common
  source.


HP_LaserJet 44.21 (16.9.99)

- Added locale support.

- Now indicates where the printable page area starts.


HP_LaserJet 44.22 (22.9.99)

- Setting the page size in the raster printing code also
  caused the page to be ejected, causing strip printing
  to break. Fixed.

- The command to end raster printing didn't work on the
  LaserJet III. Who cares, it takes only a few bytes more
  to get the same effect out of old PCL commands...


HP_LaserJet 44.23 (29.9.99)

- Switched over to use "sys/devs.catalog" for its localized
  strings.


HP_LaserJet 44.24 (24.11.1999)

- Integrated Jochen's page size changes. This should correct
  the problems with the top page margin of the first page
  printed.
