StringSnip is part of the ViNCEd distribution. It can be used as a stand-
alone application, but the vnc.library and SetVNC is required for 
customization.

The following table shows the default configuration for string gadget hooks:

Alt+Cursor keys:	Move to beginning of next/previous word
Alt+Ctrl+Cursor keys:	Move to beginning of next/previous path component
Shift+Cursor keys:	Move to start/end of the contents.
Alt+Cursor keys:	ditto.
Alt+Del:		Clear the contents.
Shift+Del:		ditto.
ALT+Backspace:		Erase to the beginning of the word under the cursor
Shift+Alt+Del:		Erase text behind the cursor
Shift+Alt+BS:		Erase text before the cursor position
Amiga+X:		Cut the contents of the gadget to the clipboard
Amiga+C:		Copy the contents to the clipboard
Amiga+V:		Insert the clipboard contents into the gadget
Shift+Amiga+V:		Replace the string gadget contents by the clipboard
Aniga+Q:		Undo-operation
Ctrl+Tab:		TAB expansion
Ctrl+Shift+Tab:		TAB expansion backwards
Commodore-key:		Turn off the extended editing features temporary


The configuration is, however, fully adjustable with the SetVNC program
of the "ViNCEd" package, see below for details.

The TAB expansion is a "cut down" version of the ViNCEd style expansion
mechanism without a double-TAB requester, without the complete command
path search and without a TAB expansion cache.
Please note that string gadget does not come with a "natural" directory the 
TAB expansion should search in, hence the path to be expanded must be either
absolute or relative to the boot volume, i.e. SYS:


Installation:
	Copy to your C: drawer.

	StringSnip install	To install the extended editing features
	StringSnip remove	To remove it again.

Additionally:	
	Copy the demo prefs file below to ENVARC:StringSnip.prefs and 
	add the line

	StringSnip PREFS ENV:StringSnip.prefs INSTALL

Extended options, full synopsis:

StringSnip INSTALL/S,REMOVE/S,PREFS/K,HELP/S


INSTALL/S			Installs the enhanced string edit hook
				or replaces a previously installed 
				"StringSnip" copy.
				This is the default operation.

REMOVE/S			Remove the StringSnip hook.

PREFS/K				Specifies a file name where the preferences
				should be taken from. This is a text based
				ViNCEd-compatible preferences file. It
				should be created by the "SetVNC" program
				and should be placed somehwere in the ENV:
				drawer.
				THIS OPTION REQUIRES the vnc.library, i.e.
				ViNCEd must have been installed.

HELP/S				Prints a tiny overview about the command line
				options.

The preferences file: 

It is recommended that you use the "SetVNC" program of the ViNCEd package
to generate this file, as the vnc.library is required anyways to read it.

As last resort, an ASCII editor is enough to edit this file, though.

The file is a listing of options, followed by an "=" ("equals") sign,
followed by the value you want to set the option to. This must be "on"
or "off" for boolean options, a number for numerical or a key specification
for the keyboard configuration options. Commands must be introduced by a
semicolon.

StringSnip 2.01:

- Almost a complete rewrite, fully configurable with ViNCEd style
  preferences (vnc.library required).
- Includes now TAB expansions and much more editor commands.

StringSnip 2.02:

- The NumLock function was erraneously bound to Alt-Ü on german
  keyboards. Never thrust a Data-Becker book, especially when
  looking up key-codes.

StringSnip 2.03:

- Fixed a possible incompatibility of Amiga-V that could have
  resulted in inserting a string twice if the application edit
  hook is able to parse this key as well.

StringSnip 2.04:

- Due to some unfortune, an internal structure appeared on an odd
  address which caused a crash on 68000 and 68010 based systems.
  Nothing else changed.

StringSnip 2.05:

- The possible TAB expansions are now sorted alphabetically.
- Note that in case you want both the functions "Insert 
  Clipboard" and "Replace by Clipboard", the keyboard strings
  PASTE=RAmiga v and PASTE=RAmiga V must be defined *both* and
  must be defined to both the same ViNCEd function.

StringSnip 2.06:

- The 2.05 release handled soft links incorrectly and crashed
  upon detection of such a beast. Fixed.
