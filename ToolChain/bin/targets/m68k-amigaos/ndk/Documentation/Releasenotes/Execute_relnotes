    Major rewrite. A *LOT* has been rewritten. No longer prints out
    a trailing 0 byte when printing the help template. Should no
    longer crash on too many arguments. Should no longer
    potentially leave dangling output handles. Invalid args
    are rejected. White space in scripts should be handled
    correctly now. Comments can be in the first lines of script
    before the first directive now. Arguments can now be numeric or
    strings. Filename is really required now as the template
    suggests. S: can now be a multiassign for scripts. Added quite
    a few error messages and checks. Now does decent temp file name
    generation which should be *very* smart, compared to the
    previous way of doing things. *MAJOR*REWRITE*. Parsing and
    argument substituition in scripts and defaults has changed
    significantly! NOTE: Some of the new features are enhancements
    and incompatible. Make sure your scripts are tested under <=V40
    if you want them compatible. Yes, executable length stayed the
    same.
    Froze 44.1.
    Fixed an enforcer hit that had not been discovered during
    testing. /S (and /T) args should be handled correctly again.
    BTW, V44.1 did already correct <$$> substition in .DEF lines,
    which the old execute did not.
    Froze 44.2.
    If any whitespace was found before the first command, that command
    was not executed. As it turns out, this may well be a bug in
    dos.library. I have added a benign workaround to Execute. Also,
    /M should now work for strings and numerics. Someone here
    looked really very hard to find a bug to make me do this.
    Froze 44.3.
    As it turns out, quoting quotd to much and did not quote quotes
    correctly.
    Froze 44.4.
