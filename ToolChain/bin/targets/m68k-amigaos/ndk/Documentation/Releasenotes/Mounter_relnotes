Mounter 44.1 (19.4.99)

- Bumped to V44.


Mounter 44.2 (9.6.99)

- Updated the catalog descriptor text.

- Finally wrote some sort of documentation.


Mounter 44.3 (22.6.99)

- Added the NOREMOUNT option and also updated
  the documentation.

Mounter 44.4 (23.8.99)

- Implemented Reaction GUI.

Mounter 44.5 (25.8.99)

- Added fuelgauge status while scanning devices. This will
  be more pleasant to the eyes than a flickering listbrowser.

Mounter 44.6 (27.8.99)

- Window will now open at bottom of titlebar

Mounter 44.7 (29.8.99)

  (Olafs diff bugfix from his 44.4 29.8.99)
- LSEG blocks in RDBs did not load properly. In the first place,
  the data didn't get loaded at all. Fixing that wouldn't have helped
  much since the ReadFunc() call, as passed to the function table
  used by InternalLoadSeg(), was following the dos.library documentation
  and would consequently use the wrong registers. I fixed both. Dammit!

Mounter 44.8 (6.9.99)

  (Olafs diff bugfix from his 44.5 5.9.99)
- Media size calculation didn't work well for some devices. I implanted
  the calculation code Workbench uses, which should solve the problem.

Mounter 44.9 (10.9.99)

- Added new tag for handling columninfo in the LB properly.
- Fixed: If a RDB wasn't found for a selected device, the error requester would
  be shown and the device list would be empty.

Mounter 44.10 (18.9.99)

- Added: conditional code that will prohibit a device entry from showing up if
         there isn't one there.
- Fixed: device size is now shown correctly.

Mounter 44.11 (20.9.99)

- Removed: conditional code applied in v44.10 as expected results returned from
           weren't always as expected.  Besides, best to keep consistancy
           between the GT and RA versions of this app.

- Fixed: Hit on exit. Window was being disposed before it was being referenced
         one last time to free draw info.

Mounter 44.12 (21.9.99)

- Fixed: QUERY option from command line, the sizes were compiled out with #ifdef's.

Mounter 44.13 (23.9.99)

  (Olafs diff bugfix from his 44.6 23.9.99)
- Joanne Dow suggested that in order to query the size of a device, the
  "Read capacity" command should be used instead of the "Mode sense"
  command. That's what Mounter does now.

Mounter 44.14 (29.9.99)

- Recompile with full optimization.
- Frozen.

Mounter 44.15 (29.9.99)

- Fixed crash causing machine locks after mount. Seems more code got caught in
  the #ifdef war ;)
- Frozen

Mounter 44.15 (01.10.99)

- Version correction.
- Frozen

--- OS 3.5 release ---

Mounter 44.16

- Fixed: Hotkey in window title was wrong on second start

- Increased initial window size

- Changed layout a bit

Mounter 44.17 (29.11.99)

- fixed a bug in wbstartup introduced in last 44.16
