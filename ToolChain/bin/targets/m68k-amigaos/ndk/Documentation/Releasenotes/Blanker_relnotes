Blanker 44.11 (18.8.99)

Blanker 44.12 (21.8.99)

Blanker 44.13 (26.8.99)

- Window now opens at bottom of screen border

Blanker 44.14 (10.9.99)

- Recompiled using new options and compilation skeleton.

NOTE: The color cycling issue is mainly related to RTG screenmodes > 8bit.
      So, being as Blanker clones WB and it would be alot of work to interrogate
      the system for all possible RTG system screenmodes <= 8bit, H&P have
      made the decision to remove this option if animation is disabled.

Blanker 44.15 (25.9.99)

- Replaced static app name for icon with dynamic determined on startup.
