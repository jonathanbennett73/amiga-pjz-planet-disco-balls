ShowConfig 44.1 (9.6.99)

- Now tries to associate manufacturer IDs with known manufacturer
  names.

- Fixed the broken MMU type detection (which only worked for the
  68851 and the 68030) to also detect an '040/'060 MMU. The
  code can still fail with the embedded versions of the '040/'060
  family, but these don't work in an Amiga anyway...

- Added '060 detection code.


ShowConfig 44.2 (18.6.99)

- CPU type detection code did not properly clean up after itself,
  crashing on machines lacking '040/'060 CPUs. Fixed.


ShowConfig 44.3 (19.6.99)

- Added manufacturer IDs for AB Union and VMC.


ShowConfig 44.4 (29.8.99)

- Added aliases for Macro System manufacturer IDs.


ShowConfig 44.5 (6.11.1999)

- Changed the MMU type detection code for the '030 case.


ShowConfig 44.6 (24.11.1999)

- Changed the entry for "Michigan Software" to read "DKB, Inc.".


ShowConfig 44.7 (25.11.1999)

- Added new entry for "RBM Digitaltechnik".


ShowConfig 44.8 (31.12.1999)

- Renamed "AB Union" to "ITH".


ShowConfig 45.1 (8.2.1999)

- Added 'Individual Computers' and 'Ambience Creation Technology'.
