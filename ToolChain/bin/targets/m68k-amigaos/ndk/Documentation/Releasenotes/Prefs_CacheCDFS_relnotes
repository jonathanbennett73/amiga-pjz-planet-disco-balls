CacheCDFS 44.1 (3.8.99)

 Initial release for Reaction. Most of code is identical to the original
  GadTools version so it should work without many bugs.

  Changes to GadTools version:

   Uses Reaction classes, resizable, iconifyable window

   Added group labels
  
   Changed window title
  
   Removed About... menu item
  
   Removed error message if program icon not found: the message is not 
    displayed if started from workbench and not important if started from
    CLI.
  
   Added version string
  
   Added localization, strings are part of system preferences catalog
  
   Ctrl-C cancles program, Ctrl-F brings window to front (like all other
    preferences windows)
  
   Removed close gadget from window

CacheCDFS 44.2 (9.8.99)

 Changing integer gadgets caused enforcer hits.

 uniconfiy and possible startup (no reproducable) caused hits.

 added a lot of GA_TabCycle tags

CacheCDFS 44.4 (18.8.99)

 added close gadget

 added seperator line

 modified Save/Use/Cancel layout

 modified some group title layouts

 I didn't find a layout that works with 640x200. Now it opens an own screen
  using AutoScroll if needed. The height is now 256, which should work with
  topaz/8, layout spacing 1 and as soon as the layout spacing bug in 
  layout.gadget is fixed.

CacheCDFS 44.5 (8.9.99)

 fixed typo in catalog file name.

 starting CDFSPrefs a second time crashed.

퇏starting CDFSPrefs a second time now activates the first started program
  (like all other prefs tools do)

 changed window title

CacheCDFS 44.6 (17.9.99)

 screen height must be at least 270 or a larger custom screen will be
  opened. But you must use topaz/8, GadTools layout and layout spacing 1.

CacheCDFS 44.11 (1.10.99)

 screen width must now be at least 704 or a larger screen will be opened.

퇏uses now name of Executable as title for iconify icon.

 iconify icon is unsnapshot on startup

CacheCDFS 44.12 (1.10.99)

 changed layout a but to make it smaller. A 640 wide screen should be enough
  now for all locales but I stay with the autoscroll screen dimensions.
