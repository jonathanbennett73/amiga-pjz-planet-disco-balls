chooser.gadget 45.1 (14.11.2000)

 an image set with GA_Image is used in drop down choosers without title. It
  replaces the chooser popup glyph.

chooser.gadget 45.2 (28.02.2001)

 implemented new tag CHOOSER_LabelArray.

chooser.gadget 45.3 (08.03.2001)

 added CHOOSER_Justification tag that allows to change the
  label placement.

 added missing SetDrMd(rp,JAM1); which could lead to wrong
  text rendering when refreshing the button.

 for choosers with only two entries no popup menu will be shown
  <Mario Cattaneo>.

 the title text of the gadget when in dropdown mode, may have
  a keyboard shortcut, now.

chooser.gadget 45.4 (15.03.2001)

 if you don't like to see the popup menu of choosers with only two entries,
  you can set the env: variable "classes/gadgets/chooser.gadget" to
  "MAXCYCLE=2".

 if you want to have a 3d menu, set the variable to "3DLOOK". Due to a bug
  in layers.library the background won't shine through the shadow on a pure
  ECS/AGA based system.

chooser.gadget 45.5 (21.03.2001)

 the popup window is opened in simple-refresh mode, now. This works around
  the layers bug mentioned above <Massimo Tantignone>.

 it's no longer possible to cycle to an item that "lies" outside of
  CHOOSER_MaxLabels <Massimo Tantignone>.

chooser.gadget 45.6 (01.09.2001)

 added GA_GadgetHelpText support.

 the selected image of a node was never drawn because of a copy'n'paste
  bug.
  
chooser.gadget 45.7 (22.10.2001)

 just some artwork and a new env option called DRAWFRAME. Try it together
  with 3DLOOK and you'll see... :)
