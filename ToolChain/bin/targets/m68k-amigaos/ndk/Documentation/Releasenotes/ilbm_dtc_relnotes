ilbm 44.1 (13.3.99)

- Completely rewritten from scratch.

- Now requires Kickstart 3.1.


ilbm 44.2 (13.3.99)

- Added true colour support. This includes the 12, 15, 18,
  21 and 24 bit variants used by ASDG and NewTek software.


ilbm 44.3 (14.3.99)

- Now honours the "colour map is really 8 bits
  wide" flag proposed for use in the BitMapHeader.


ilbm 44.4 (16.3.99)

- Now requires picture.datatype V43.


ilbm 44.5 (17.3.99)

- For true colour picture data the BitMapHeader now always
  reports the picture depth to be 24 bits, regardless of
  whether it was really 24 bits or less. This is because
  the conversion process always yields 24 bit colour data.


ilbm 44.6 (20.4.99)

- Added support for the PDTA_GetNumPictures and PDTA_WhichPicture
  tags.

- Smarter descriptor now allows for ILBM chunks to be in CATs
  and LISTs.


ilbm 44.7 (23.4.99)

- True colour picture data with a width that is not a multiple
  of 16 no longer causes the planar to chunky conversion code
  to crash.


ilbm 44.8 (27.6.99)

- The descriptor code was too "smart". It even mis-identified
  IFF-ANIM files as being IFF-ILBM files. Considering that
  IFF-ANIM files do contain lists of embedded IFF-ILBM chunks
  it was right about it. Still, that's too smart and now
  the code stops reading if it hits a FORM ANIM chunk.


ilbm 44.9 (2.8.2000)

- No longer loads palette mapped image data that doesn't sport
  any colour palette information.
