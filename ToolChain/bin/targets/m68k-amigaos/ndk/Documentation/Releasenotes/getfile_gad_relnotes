getfile.gadget 44.7 (09.11.00)

- recompiled with gnuc making it 1k smaller :)

- bugfixed library code.

- the gadget didn't pass GA_TextAttr/REACTION_TextAttr to its
  string.gadget child. when the current font wasn't the screen
  font, the string.gadget used the wrong font for rendering when
  it got active.
  
- you can "tabcycle" to and from the gadget, now.


getfile.gadget 45.0 (17.11.00)

- bumped version to 45.

- the display resolution is now taken into account when calculating
  the size of the getfile image. 

- passes GA_TabCycle to its string.gadget, now. Tabcycling
  works again, when string.gadget >= 45.5 is installed.


getfile.gadget 45.1 (20.02.01)

- fixed GETFILE_FileList, the list was possibly never build
  because the gadget didn't CD to the home directory of 
  the selected file(s) before Lock()ing them/it.


getfile.gadget 45.2 (28.02.01)

- implemented GM_CLIPRECT.

- recompiled with new startup code.

- passes the right mouse coordinates to its string.gadget
  object, now.
