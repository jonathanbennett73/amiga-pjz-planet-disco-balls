kickstart/console

    Fixed the window list walk bug and made some minor corrections
    and improvements to the code. The open function should behave
    better now internally. Hopefully it will be possible to not
    have it rely on Forbid() in the future as this can hold up the
    machine for a *long* time when a new large console is opened.

    An internal signal could have been not caught under very
    strange circumstances. Not that anyone out there would have
    ever really noticed.

    console.device should no longer try to mask bitplanes on chunky
    displays. This should fix it on gfx boards. console.device
    should no longer depend on Forbid() during open. Note that
    this may not be of general usefulness due to the way the
    system is and has been hacked up to now.

    The mask magic for chunky bitplanes was calculated correctly
    but the calculated values were not used correctly. 2nd try.
    Froze 44.6.
    A minor glitch could have caused a trashed window border when
    resizing a console when the cursor needed to be rendered.
    Froze 44.7.
    Removed a potential semaphore deadlock situation.
