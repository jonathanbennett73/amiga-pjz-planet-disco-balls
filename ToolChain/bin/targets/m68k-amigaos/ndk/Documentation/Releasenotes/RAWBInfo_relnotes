RAWBInfo 1.19 (27.10.00)

- disables the "Tooltypes" menu whenever the "Icon" page isn't visible,
  selecting an item from the menu while the page wasn't active ended up
  in a crash <opi>. This was actually the fault of texteditor.gadget and
  not RAWBInfo.
   
- integrated smoothing code from Image2Icon into RAWBInfo.

- dragging icons on the window should work as expected even when DirOpus 
  is running, in opposite to the original wb the dropzones won't be 
  highlighted when dragging an icon over them (DO is missing the re-
  required functionality).
  
- rawbinfo lowers its task priority while calculating the size of drawers/
  disks, this way your system doesn't get blocked. 
  
- added I2I=IMAGE2ICON/K,I2IOPTS=IMAGE2ICONOPTS/K options <Mario Cattaneo>.

- the minimum stacksize that can be entered into the appropiate gadget is 
  4096bytes, now (that's the minimum wb allows) <opi>. 
  
- new ICONFIRST/S option. 

- holding down SHIFT while clicking on a tooltype will dis-/enable it (the
  implementation is a bit tricky but it works:).

- disabled "Icon Images / Extras / Delete alternate image" for the time 
  BoingBag#2 isn't available (the program actually checks the revision
  number of icon.library before disabling the item).
  
- it's possible to "tab-cycle" from and to the tooltypes editor, now. 

- added shortcuts to the english gadget and menu texts where they were 
  missing.

- removed the "Protection:" label in front of the checkboxes, this way 
  their shortcuts will work.
  
- the program makes sure now, that the "Name:" field only contains the
  filepart of the path and not the complete path. 
  
- pressing SHIFT+RETURN inside the tooltypes editor terminates it <opi>.

- the program didn't filter system tooltypes (CLI,REXX,TOOLPRI,...)
  correctly, for an example CLICK was identified as CLI.


RAWBInfo 1.20 (31.10.00)

- removed support for gtdrag.library. The library never worked well
  (deadlocks during dragging) and as being an OS component RAWBInfo
  shouldn't need/use any third party product (which is not licensed).


RAWBInfo 1.21 (04.11.00)

- the notification mechanism introduced in 1.18 could crash the program
  when an icon information window was opened in the context of the same
  task more than one time. This only happend when the user saved the
  icon to disk and therefore caused a notification to be sent to the task.
  The next time the user opened an icon information window, the notification
  signal was still set and crashed the program.

- when the size of a drawer is 0 bytes and x blocks, a different formatting 
  string is used which only shows the drawer size in blocks. This is what
  the original wb icon information does.


RAWBInfo 1.22 (09.11.00)

- because of a missing function prototype the program threw enforcer hits,
  whenever the user changed an icon (by a different program, eg IconEdit)
  that was shown in the icon information window <Eike M. Lang>.

- pasting a transparent image works again as long as RAWBInfo doesn't need
  to scale down the image <Andrea Vallinotto>.
  
- resizing a window forced a 2nd refresh (bug was introduced in 1.21).

- using the arrows of the Stacksize integer.gadget de-/increases the shown
  value by 1024, now (requires integer.gadget v45) <Mario Cattaneo>.


RAWBInfo 1.23 (16.11.00)

- (de)activating a tooltype by using shift+lmb no longer destroys the 
  contents of the clipboard. NOTE: You can only (de)activate a single
  tooltype at a time, now. Thanks to Allan for his help.  

- "Icon Images/Frameless?" is now disabled when the icon is a NewIcon.


RAWBInfo 1.24 (20.11.00)

- removed the spacing btw the texteditor.gadget and the scroller.gadget
  that was introduced by fixing window.class.

- added APPICON/S option. when this option is set, the program adds
  an AppIcon on which you can drop other icons to get information on
  them.
  
- The "Icon Image / Save..." filerequester wasn't set to savemode.


RAWBInfo 1.25 (26.12.00)

- when the user has double-clicked a tooltype (while holding down
  SHIFT), the input-event is no longer passed to the texteditor.gadget.
  Instead the tooltype will be toggled <Mario Cattaneo>.

- removed some unnecessary spacing between the protection checkboxes.

- when changing the icontype, the default stacksize is taken from
  workbench prefs, now <Mario Cattaneo>.


RAWBInfo 1.26 (09.01.01)

- holding down SHIFT while dropping an icon over the tooltypes editor
  inserts the tooltypes of the icon.
  
- disabled underscoring for all non selectable gadgets.

- when a tooltype begins with a non alphanumerical character, the
  character will be ignored when sorting the tooltypes list. So
  enabled and disabled tooltypes will appear mixed in the list instead
  of having the disabled tooltypes at the top.


RAWBInfo 1.27 (05.03.01)

- when the object on which information is shown is a link, its name
  will be underlined.

- After one hour of debugging trying to find out why each information
  window ate 65kb of memory I found the reason: the OM_NEW method of
  the icon gadget called OM_SET and OM_SET called the OM_NEW method
  of the superclass and the superclass ... A really stupid mistake. 
  Somebody please give me a kick in my [censored].
  
- should handle WBDISK icons correctly even when they aren't named disk
  <Mario Cattaneo>.

- the "Protection: " label in front of the checkboxes is back, again.
  Please note that you need label.image 45.1 to keep their shortcuts
  "alive".


RAWBInfo 1.28 (30.03.01)

- fixed mungwall damage caused by passing a string to button.gadget
  that was allocated on the stack.


RAWBInfo 1.29 (11.04.01)

- dropping an disk icon (or any other type of icon without tooltypes)
  on the tooltypes editor could crash the machine <Martin Elsner>.


RAWBInfo 1.30 (18.04.01)

- when DefIcons is running the filetype will be displayed, now 
  <Martin Steigerwald>.


RAWBInfo 1.31 (30.04.01)

- fixed icon display problem introduce in 1.30 <Mario Cattaneo>.


RAWBInfo 1.32 (03.06.01)

- "Icon Images / Extra / Delete alternate image" was always ghosted
  on a system with icon.library v45 <David Rey>.
  
 
RAWBInfo 1.33 (03.08.01)

- it's possible to change the name of an icon, now. A new string 
  (MSG_NAME_FMT2) has been added to the catalog.


RAWBInfo 1.34 (08.08.01)

- double-clicking the icon will "c:wbrun" the file (allows to view
  image files this way).

- the icon name can be changed by drag'n'drop, now.

- when saving an icon back to disk, only the information that has
  been changed (this includes the comment, the protection bits and
  the filename) will be saved.


RAWBInfo 1.35 (31.08.01)

- removed some experimental code that made it into the last release
  by mistake.

- reworked the rename code.
