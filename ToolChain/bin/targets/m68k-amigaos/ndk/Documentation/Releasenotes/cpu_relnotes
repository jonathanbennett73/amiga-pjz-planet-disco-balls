cpu 44.1 (9.6.99)

- Original code could forget whether it had identified an MMU or
  not and would have wound up printing junk were not the MMU type
  test made to look for 68851. Similar effects for the '030 MMU,
  depending upon whether the MMUTEST/S option was used or not. Fixed.

- Original code would fail to evaluate the CHECK/K option properly.
  In fact, whatever option to test for was ignored and a "test"
  was performed that would cause the program to always return "test
  condition not met", rendering this feature useless. Fixed.

- Now knows the '060 (and actually tests for it rather than
  trusting the AttnFlags).

- The CHECK/K option can now test for the presence of an '060.


cpu 44.2 (18.6.99)

- CPU type detection code did not properly clean up after itself,
  crashing on machines lacking '040/'060 CPUs. Fixed.


CPU 44.3 (6.11.1999)

- Changed the MMU type detection code for the '030 case.
