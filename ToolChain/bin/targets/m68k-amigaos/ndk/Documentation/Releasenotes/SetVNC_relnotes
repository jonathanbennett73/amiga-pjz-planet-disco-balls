	SetVNC 41.43

- If the guide lacks an icon, the browser
  defaults now to MultiView. 
- SetVNC does now no longer try to allocate
  a sprite for showing an additional color if
  openend on a non-native screen. Causes only
  trouble, and there is no hardware sprite anyhow.
- SetVNC prints now RGB values as ranges from 0
  to 255 similar to the preferences "Palette"
  tool.
- SetVNC allows now adjustment of the double TAB
  delay time with the special value of zero.
- Fixed an Enforcer hit in the argument parser.

	SetVNC 41.44

- The color selection increments now in steps of
  one unit instead of steps of 16 units.
- Included the "Easy Setup" flag. You find it
  on the second "About" page. Please check wether
  the selection of flags is convenient for the
  beginner.

	SetVNC 41.45

- The first System page forbid the user to exit
  if the guide location was incorrect. Note that
  this is intentional, but I nevertheless changed
  the behaivour.

	SetVNC 41.46

- Due to an oversight (a trashed register) 
  "SetVNC Help" could have crashed in case the
  guide file came with a ".info".

	SetVNC 41.47

- Strange enough, the argument parser enforcer 
  hit reappeared in 41.45. Fixed again.
