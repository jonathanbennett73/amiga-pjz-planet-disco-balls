space.gadget 44.2 (20.01.01)

- bugfixed library code.

- the OM_DISPOSE method didn't call the super method,
  resulting in a memory leak.


space.gadget 45.0 (28.02.01)

- bumped to v45, clipping is now supported (for use
  in virtual groups).

- the size of the bevel (when requested) was always 6x4.


space.gadget 45.1 (02.03.01)

- removed clipping support, no real need in this class ;)

- recompiled with new startup code.
