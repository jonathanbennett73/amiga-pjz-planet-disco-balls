HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.2 (28.8.99)

- Dithering and gamma correction finally work.

- Replaced the compression code with the HP code.
  There's something not quite right with the
  ByteRun1 compressor :(


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.3 (28.8.99)

- Colour correction is now applied to all colour components at the
  same time rather than at the individual components. This will become
  more important for the CMY printer driver.

- If no colour correction is to be performed, no longer bothers to
  apply 1:1 mapping tables or to allocate memory that is never going
  to be used.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.4 (28.8.99)

- Now supports printing coloured text.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.5 (29.8.99)

- If printing in black/white or greyscale mode with "Letter" quality
  printing selected, the printing resolution is now quadrupled
  (from 300x300 to 600x600 DPI).


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.6 (2.9.99)

- Recalculated the gamma correction tables. The new tables will
  print brighter, with more contrast.

- Fixed an overrun bug in the compression code.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.7 (2.9.99)

- Revised the paper and page sizes again; they now reflect
  the sizes given in the official PCL 5 documentation.

- The text top margin is now set to 0 rows (used to be
  2 rows).

- Enabled perforation skip mode for text printing.

- Graphics printing now also sets the page size.

- Printing setup now also allows for paper size A3
  to be used (provided your printer can handle paper
  that large).


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.8 (6.9.99)

- Floyd-Steinberg dithering now alternates the direction
  in which the image data is processed with every line.
  This will result in smoother error distribution and
  improve output quality.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.9 (6.9.99)

- Now includes information about the functionality
  associated with the density settings.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.10 (13.9.99)

- 600 DPI output is no longer tied to the Draft/Letter
  quality settings.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.11 (13.9.99)

- Now generates all CMYK HP DeskJet variants from one common
  source.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.12 (16.9.99)

- Added locale support.

- Now indicates where the printable page area starts.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.13 (22.9.99)

- Setting the page size in the raster printing code also
  caused the page to be ejected, causing strip printing
  to break. Fixed.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.14 (29.9.99)

- Switched over to use "sys/devs.catalog" for its localized
  strings.


HP_DeskJet_CMYK 44.15 (24.11.1999)

- Integrated Jochen's page size changes. This should correct
  the problems with the top page margin of the first page
  printed.
