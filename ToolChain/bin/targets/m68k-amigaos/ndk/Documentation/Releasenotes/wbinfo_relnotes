wbinfo 45.0 (28-10-00)

- wbinfo is small program to open Workbench information
  windows from a shell. For each given object (file/drawer
  or disk) it will create a separate process which in turn
  calls workbench.library/WBInfo() to bring up the Icon
  information requester. Please note that the program has
  to wait for last the requester to be satisfied before it
  can quit.

- no longer fails when an icon doesn't have an associated
  drawer or file <Mario Cattaneo>.
