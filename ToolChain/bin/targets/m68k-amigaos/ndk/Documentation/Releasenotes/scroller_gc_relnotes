scroller.gadget 45.1 (15.11.2000)

 domain did not take the bporder size into account if new preferences
  were set before layouting the gadget.

 after clicking into the body of the scroller timer events replaced
  the knob randomly.

scroller.gadget 45.2 (18.11.2000)

 seems to run stable, so removed debugging output

scroller.gadget 45.3 (28.02.2001)

 implemented GM_CLIPRECT method for use in virtual groups.

 fixed placement in window borders.

 the SCROLLER_Top value couldn't be changed without a GInfo.

scroller.gadget 45.4 (13.03.2001)

 optimized rendering code.

 OM_UPDATE returns != 0L when the class has been "subclassed"
  and a refresh is needed.

 the size of the gadget is based on the screen aspect ratio,
  now. Thanks to Massimo Tantignone for the code.

 enabled activation via keyboard shortcut (not only via tabcycling).

scroller.gadget 45.5 (16.03.2001)

 again changed the size calculation.

 depending on the input parameters the scroller could never reach
  the maximum top when playing with the knob. Let's hope that
  nothing got broken, now.

 OM_UPDATE should really return != 0 when receiving a message from
  the arrow buttons.

scroller.gadget 45.6 (23.03.2001)

 did some "finetuning" to the code that calculates the gadget size.

scroller.gadget 45.7 (27.03.2001)

 Sigh, adjusted scroller sizes once again.

scroller.gadget 45.8 (13.10.2001)

 The default look of the scroller (= non 3D) defaults to the
  so called NEWLOOK, now. When the screen where rendering takes
  place is not a NEWLOOK one the traditional non 3D look will
  be used instead.

 added GA_GadgetHelpText support.
