kickstart/exec.library

    This is the start of exec V45. First of all, it should be
    flexible enough now to allow general RAM loading.
    First I have to be convinced that all of this is solid! BTW,
    this exec also should make PrepareEmul obsolete, adds fast
    large pools, the exec related SetPatch content, and AVL tree
    support.
    Froze 45.7.
    The beta alert will show the exec type now for easier bug
    reporting. I still can't reproduce a single issue. *sigh*
    Froze 45.9.
    Argh! I think I have the main issue. Due to a stupid oversight,
    Exec tried to checksum RAM, not ROM areas, depending on the
    memory map of the machine in question. A label change fixed
    this. As it turned out, I also stomped on some registers that
    I better should not have messed up.
    Froze 45.10.
    If Exec turns out to be in chip mem, it shouldn't be able
    to blow itself out of the water anymore when sizing chip mem.
    Froze 45.11.
    Header cleanup for types and proto generation. Beta Alert
    turned off.
    Froze 45.12.
    The builtin check for Exec not to trash itself on startup ...
    did unfortunately exactly that due to an incorrect label. This
    should be fixed now.
    Froze 45.13.
    Slight tweaks to the memory layout for better loading support.
    No code change.
    Froze 45.15.
    As it turns out, Exec could find Ranger memory on many machines
    and die at times, even if there was no Ranger memory. Basically,
    this depended on the state the machine was in when it was
    rebooted. This is an old <=V40 bug and has been fixed now. The
    internal ReadGayle() function was similarly affected and could
    have found a Gayle where there is none. This *should* be fixed
    now. Strange what you can find when you are looking for
    something completely different. It took me quite a while to
    debug this because it stopped the other work completely. Arghh!
    Froze 45.16.
    ColdReboot() now tries harder to do the right thing on 040/060
    systems and on any systems that had the VBR moved.
    Froze 45.17.
    Streamlined exec pools handling. No more need for V40 style
    pool support. No functional change.
    Froze 45.18.
    Header generation was not completely correct. No functional
    change. Headers should be ok now.
    Still at 45.18.
