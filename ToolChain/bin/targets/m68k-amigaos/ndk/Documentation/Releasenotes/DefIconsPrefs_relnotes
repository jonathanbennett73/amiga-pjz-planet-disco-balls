DefIconsPrefs 45.0 (27-10-00)

- just a version bump, no functional change.


DefIconsPrefs 45.1 (31-10-00)

- the program makes sure that the provided stack 
  is large enough (at least 6k). If not a new stack
  of 8k will be allocated <Jochen Becher>.


DefIconsPrefs 45.2 (12-11-00)

- Jochen asked me to remove the WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM flag, 
  so I did :) The window has a thick right border, now.
  
- implemented support for iconification.

- if the gui doesn't fit on the screen, the program will
  open an autoscroll screen for it.

- changed layout of bottom group.


DefIconsPrefs 45.3 (15-11-00)

- the buttons of the search requester have their own
  locale string, now.
  
- added "Settings/Create Icon?" menu item.

- localized the window title.


DefIconsPrefs 45.4 (17-11-00)

- the renderhook of the listbrowser didn't take care
  of NULL pointers, therefore listbrowser.gadget threw some
  enforcerhits when a new action was added to the list
  <Mario Cattaneo>.

- the programname is now used as the title of the appicon.

- should no longer open a lores screen when the GUI doesn't
  fit on the wbscreen.
  

DefIconsPrefs 45.5 (19-11-00)

- the fallback screen has a depth of 2, now.


DefIconsPrefs 45.6 (25-11-00)

- autoscrolling should really work, now.

- for the case that the window opens on a own screen,
  there will be *no* iconifygadget anymore.


DefIconsPrefs 45.7 (04-12-00)

- instead of using BestModeIDA() to get a displaymode for
  the fallback screen, the wb screen will be cloned, now.


DefIconsPrefs 45.8 (06-02-01)

- running multiple instances of the program is no longer
  possible <David Rey>.

- when opening a file which is not a valid DefIcons prefs 
  file, the current settings don't get lost any longer
  <David Rey>.

- when the user changes an icon, the internal cache
  of DefIcons will be flushed.


DefIconsPrefs 45.10 (26-04-01)

  a buffer overflow <Thomas Richter>.
