rexxmathlib.library 38.03

- The POW() function has been optimized and will use a smart
  recursive multiplication for integer exponents.
- Unfortunately, I still require a patch for the broken
  MathIEEEDCmp() routine of the mathieeedoubbas.library.

rexxmathlib.library 45.1
	
- bumped to 45.1
- removed my copyright.

rexxmathlib.library 45.2

- Rewrote Pow() again to use now the function of the mathieee
  doubtrans.library since this function has now been fixed.
- Added some additional sanity checks for transzendental functions.
- Rewrote EPSP() and EPSM(). Even though their implementation is
  now correct on the basis of IEEE numbers, they are still useless
  due to the limited precision of the IEEE->Ascii conversion, and
  the limited precision of ARexx itself.
