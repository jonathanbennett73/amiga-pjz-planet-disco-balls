animation 44.13 (9.3.99)

- The frame conversion code that transforms frame bitmaps for
  display no longer assumes that the display bitmaps are in
  planar format. The code recognizes CyberGraphX format bitmaps
  and actually takes advantage of their format.

- The IFF-ILBM frame storage code was never reentrant. It still
  is not reentrant, but the code now properly serializes accesses
  to the global data structures it modifies.

- Similar to picture.datatype, the OBP_Precision tag can now be
  used to control the pen allocation precision.

- The colour allocation code now reserves space for up to 256
  colours for later use with per-frame colour map allocation.

- The layout code now treats HAM (4096 colours) and HAM8
  (262,144 colours) as different display modes.

- The code no longer polls to see whether its child processes
  are alive (or dead) but waits for them to respond.

- The frame loader process priority is now bumped from -1 to 0
  before receiving a request to load a specific frame. In older
  revisions the loader process and the datatype to call it
  could easily starve due to system load.

- The frame loader process now properly cleans up after itself.
  In older revisions the process could exit without freeing
  all of the frames it had loaded.

- The display process now supports per-frame colour map changes.


animation 44.14 (13.3.99)

- Implemented per-frame sound period changes.

- Added the new ADTM_LOADNEWFORMATFRAME method which allows frames
  with stereo soundtrack to be loaded. There also is a new
  method ADTM_UNLOADNEWFORMATFRAME to complement it.

- Updated the header files and the autodocs.

- The OM_NEW method could return garbage in case the object
  creation failed. Fixed.


animation 44.15 (14.3.99)

- The frame saver now uses the "colour map is really 8 bits
  wide" flag proposed for use in the BitMapHeader.


animation 44.16 (27.3.99)

- Fixed a bug in the ByteRun1 compression code that
  went unnoticed for the previous 14 years.


animation 44.17 (27.3.99)

- animation.datatype now supports the DTA_Repeat attribute.


animation 44.18 (27.3.99)

- The loader did not allow for frame data to be reused by
  the subclasses, thus wasting an incredible amount of
  memory. Fixed.

- The number of frames the loader process preloads before
  animation playback starts is now configurable.


animation 44.19 (8.12.1999)

- The bitmap all display operations will store their frame
  data in is now allocated with the BMF_MINPLANES tag. This
  allows for the bitmap to be allocated in the type of
  graphics memory most suitable for the currently running
  RTG system.
