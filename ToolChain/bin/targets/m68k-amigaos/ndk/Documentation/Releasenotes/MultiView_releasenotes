MultiView 44.1 (22.4.99)

- Bumped to V44.


MultiView 44.2 (22.4.99)

- Now checks if a bitmap is displayable before using it as
  a screen custom bitmap.

- When using the V44 picture.datatype, no longer forces display
  of an object on a custom screen but relies upon picture.datatype
  to layout the object properly to the given screen.


MultiView 44.3 (24.4.99)

- Now performs bounds checking when copying, concatenating and
  formatting text strings.

- When storing a window size snapshot for a window, '/' and ':'
  characters in the screen name are silently replaced with
  '.' charactes.

- Now shows an error message if something goes wrong with reading
  or initialization before the output window is open.


MultiView 44.4 (25.4.99)

- Now uses a smart window backfill hook to display full screen
  picture data if the object's bitmap is not suitable for use
  as a custom bitmap.


MultiView 44.5 (25.4.99)

- New REPEAT and IMMEDIATE options.


MultiView 44.6 (2.5.99)

- Lost some more of the stub code. This also avoids triggering
  an Enforcer hit when opening a new object.


MultiView 44.7 (9.6.99)

- When opening a custom screen, MultiView now makes sure that
  all its pens are locked before the colour palette is loaded.
  This is both a) The Right Thing (tm) and b) fixes
  programs like MagicMenu which expect other programs to do
  The Right Thing. I also threw in some more code to
  make the palette loading more efficient. The old code would
  load the palette pen by pen, which would be painfully slow on
  AA machines. The new code attempts to build a table suitable
  for use with LoadRGB32() and falls back to the SetRGB32()
  method if there is not enough memory available.


MultiView 44.8 (12.6.99)

- No longer peeks Screen->BitMap, but uses GetBitMapAttr() to
  get the information it needs.


MultiView 44.9 (6.8.99)

- To close the MultiView window, hit ^\ or hit the [Esc]
  key twice.


MultiView 44.10 (13.8.99)

- Added new option "PRTUNIT", which configures the printer.device
  unit used for printer dumps.


MultiView 44.11 (17.8.99)

- Layer offset adjustments in window backfill hook code were
  unnecessary and could introduce errors with off-screen
  clipping rectangles. Fixed.


MultiView 44.12 (21.8.99)

- No longer needs two [Esc] characters to close the window.
  Silly idea :(


MultiView 44.13 (25.8.99)

- MultiView now gets itself a proper CLI search path list
  when launched from Workbench. This should help AmigaGuide
  when using embedded commands.


MultiView 44.14 (25.12.1999)

- When launched from Workbench, MultiView now complains showing
  an error requester if the file it is supposed to display cannot
  be loaded (such as because there is no datatype to handle it).


MultiView 44.15 (6.6.2000)

- Now closes iffparse.library upon exit (never did that before).


MultiView 45.1 (7.3.2001)

- bumbed to verion 45

- Added Navigation Menu entry with some search entries which is enabled
  for datatypes which support this (e.g. text.datatype 45.11).
  Done by Sebastian Bauer.


MultiView 45.2 (7.3.2001)

- No longer jumps back to the orginal view position after scrolling with
  the keyboard and then with the mouse again.


MultiView 45.3 (16.4.2001)

- Fixed problems with WBRun

MultiView 45.4 (17.9.2001)

- Mousewheel can be used to scroll vertical

MultiView 45.5 (9.11.2001)

- Added WINDOWLEFT,WINDOWTOP,WINDOWWIDTH,WINDOWHEIGHT shell args
  and tooltypes

MultiView 45.6 (17.11.2001)

- Corrected the shell template

MultiView 45.7 (18.11.2001)

- Set PDTA_DestMode to PMODE_V43

MultiView 45.8 (02.12.2001)

- WINDOWWIDTH and WINDOWHEIGHT now describes the complete dimensions
  of the window instead of the inner dimensions (without border)
