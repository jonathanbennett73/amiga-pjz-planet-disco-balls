locale 44.1 (5.8.99)

- Fixed an ancient buffer overrun problem in the DateToStr() patch.
  This was most apparent with country definitions that had four digit
  year numbers in them, such as italia.country or portugal.country.
  Since the length of a day/date/time string, as passed to DateToStr()
  cannot be greater than 16 characters (including the terminating NUL),
  a date string such as generated for the month December (e.g.
  " 1-Dicembre-1999", which is exactly 17 characters in size, including
  the terminating NUL) would cause the buffer to overflow. This caused
  all kinds of trouble. I limited the size of the string generated. While
  this is not exactly a good fix for the problem (the last year digit will
  "drop off"), it avoids the buffer overrun.

- Added default cases for the RawDoFmt() patch (no longer throws Enforcer
  hits on invalid formatting commands) and the ARexx character conversion
  code.


locale 44.2 (5.8.99)

- Changed the built-in default locale for united_states to use four digit
  year numbers.


locale 44.3 (9.9.99)

- In DateToStr() the '%y' code would calculate the year number minus 1900
  to obtain the two digit year number. I changed this to use the year number
  mod 100, which should do it.


locale 44.4 (24.9.99)

- The library now maintains proper usage counters for all locales it loads.
  Previously, locale.library would keep any locale loaded in memory
  indefinitely, including the associated language driver. Now everything
  that remains is the sys/dos.catalog file which, since dos.library does not
  and cannot maintain a usage counter for its strings, has to remain in
  memory once loaded (some dos.library users may cache strings).

- The library no longer bumps its usage counter every time the default
  locale is changed. This happens only once now, when the operating system
  patches are planted.

- The built-in "english" locale now has its usage count set permanently to
  1, preventing it from ever getting removed.


locale 44.5 (24.9.99)

- The ParseDate() code now specifically allows "%y" year numbers to
  have more than two digits.


locale 44.6 (7.11.1999)

- The catalog file loader no longer refuses reading catalog version
  strings if they are longer than 99 characters. It now reads a
  maximum of 99 characters and tries to make the best of it.
