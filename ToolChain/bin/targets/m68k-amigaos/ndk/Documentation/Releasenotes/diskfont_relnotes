diskfont 44.1 (1.5.99)

- Bumped to V44.

- Recompiled with SAS/C 6.58

- Converted to use registerized parameters
  throughout the library, inlined static
  functions, no longer uses A4 to reference
  data.

- Replaced the code that queries the global
  environment variable "diskfont". It now
  uses dos.library routines to read the
  variable rather than reading all the
  data on its own.

- The extended library function (offset -24) now
  returns NULL.


diskfont 44.2 (7.9.99)

- Replaced the roll-your-own case-insensitive string
  comparison code with Stricmp().

- Improved handling of soft linked objects. Their type,
  size and protection bits are now resolved, if possible.

diskfont 44.3 (21.10.00)

- Recompiled the library code with LIBCODE which
  avoids passing the library base code from
  function to function. Requires a neat trick when
  linking, don't try this at home. Main entry functions
  are now __saveds.

- Replaced some asm stubs with registerized versions.

- Major cleanup of AvailFonts(). This code looked like a
  mess. The code is now much more organized and requires 
  much less parameter passing due to reorganization. It is
  now split up into several tiny routines to make it more
  readable. Note that SAS/C supplies inlines.

- Minor improvement of olsen's "getenv()" code. It now
  parses the new variables "CACHE", "ASCENDING" and
  "DESCENDING".

- Moved glyph engine globals into the library base.

- Added font caching code. (NEW) See the readme for
  details how it works. This is a major rewrite of
  the 1.xx font caching "FontCachePatch". It is now
  integrated into the library routines in a much more
  canonical way. Old 1.xx cache files are no longer 
  recognized and will be ignored. 

diskfont 45.1 (26.10.00)

- Bumped to 45.1


diskfont 45.2 (7.11.00)

- Thought it would be a good idea not to print a
  "Volume ... is write protected" error requester
  in case the cache file could not be build. Instead,
  the caching will fail now silently. The font list
  will then be read in the traditional way.


diskfont 45.3 (16.11.00)

- Added GetDiskFontCtrl() and SetDiskFontCtrlA() to
  query and set diskfont internal data. Supposed to
  be used by the diskfont preferences program.

diskfont 45.4 (7.5.2001)

- AvailFonts sets now explicitly the file date of the
  FONTS directory after having written the cache
  file to ensure compatibility with filing systems
  that carry file modification dates along to upper
  levels of their directory tree.

diskfont 45.5 (24.7.2001)

- Added a new tag to SetDiskFontCtrl() that flushes
  the cache on demand.
