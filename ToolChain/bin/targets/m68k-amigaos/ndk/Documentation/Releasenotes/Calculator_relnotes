Calculator 45.10

- This version of the calculator does not go back to
the previous reaction based Calculator at all. It is a 
new attempt to port the V38 calculator sources to 
reaction. Therefore, no issues of the V45 have been
"fixed". Rather, they have been "avoided". 

This release comes therefore with more sophisticated
ASCII<->Float conversion routines that should avoid
rounding errors.

- Added the COMPUTE command line argument. This argument
takes an algebraic expression as input and computes the
result as floating point number. Note that the calculator
knows only the four basic operations + - * /. Brackets are
supported, so are the priorities of these operations.

Note that the calculator never attempts to output numbers
in scientific (mantissa/exponent) notation, neither as
workbench tool nor as command line tool.

- The GUI is completely new. It is a Reaction based port
of the former gadtools GUI.


Calculator 45.11

- The icon position is now reset to defaults before the icon
is placed on the workbench.

- Forgot to translate the american style decimal dot to
its localized version for some number inputs.

- Reworked the screen handling completely. Should be better
now.
