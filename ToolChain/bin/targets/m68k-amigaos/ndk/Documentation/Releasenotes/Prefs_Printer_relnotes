Printer 44.5 (17.7.99)

 Added workaround for two enforcer hits for every printer driver change.
  The bug seems to be in button gadget or loocale library.

Printer 44.6 (19.7.99)

 Removing the "Use Custom Device" checkmark did not remove the custom
  devicename.

Printer 44.6 (19.7.99)

 Not all printer drivers seems to update the PrinterExtendedData after
  opening it. Added a PRD_DUMPRPORT command.

 The page borders now takes the LeftMargin, RightMargin and PaperLength
  into account. The MaxXDots and MaxYDots are used as a limit.

 The left border now takes the LeftMargin into account

 The left and top border are now printed too if the driver does not set
  a hardware border.

Printer 44.7 (31.7.99)

 Added stack extension

 Changing density now refresh the DPI and info string while dragging slider

Printer 44.8 (9.8.99)

 Unit name missed the ICA_TARGET tag to recognize all string changes

Printer 44.9 (11.8.99)

 Scaling the sample print-out to a size smaller 1 pixel width or height
  could throw enforcer hits and crash.

Printer 44.11 (14.8.99)

 after loading a prefs file, restoring or resetting to defaults the flag
  if the unit use a custom device was not set correctly.

 the minimum of left print margin was 0 but it has to be 1.

Printer 44.12 (16.8.99)

 Improved handling of 2 color screens.

 The calculation of the sample size is done by the printer.device using the
  selected printer dirver. But it is not perfect because an application may
  set different flags for printing (or modify the preferences). Now Printer
  uses not special flags any more (used SPECIAL_FULLCOLUMNS before).

Printer 44.13 (17.8.99)

 added close gadget

 modified Save/Use/Cancel layout

 modified some group layout

 if print border is larger than paper you will now see it in the sample.

 two borderlines are drawn: a blue border (FILLPEN) for text printing and
  a black border (SHADOWPEN) for graphics printing. The gfx border is set
  from the printer driver (due to papersize and print density), the text
  border is set by the user (Print Spacing, Paper Length, Font, Left and
  Right Margins). Two small labels boxes at the right of the page describes
  which border is drawn in which color.

Printer 44.14 (20.8.99)

 added some code to make printer visible in list

 printer now opens a larger custom screen with autoscroll if the public
  screen is too small.

Printer 44.15 (8.9.99)

 if the driver from the prefs file is not found at least one enforcer hit
  were thrown.

Printer 44.16 (17.9.99)

 changed project icon name to def_printer_prefs

 fixed a bug with driver borders calculated wrong introduced in 44.13

 Printer-Device-Unit-Cyle-Gadget was not localized.

 new picture if screen depth < 6.

Printer 44.17 (23.9.99)

퇏more accuracy for DIN page sizes, printer borders etc.

 If Printer is started as project icon from PrinterGfx it not longer tries
  to load PrinterGfx as prefs file.

--- OS 3.5 release ---

Printer 44.23 (24.11.99)

 fixed a bug in framework which may lead to a deadlock while resizing the
  window.

--- OS 3.9 release ---

Printer 45.1 (18.12.2000)

 Fix: If this tool was used with SAVE or USE, the internal printer.device
  unit was not closed.

Printer 45.2 (17.08.2001)

 stephanr: the drawing process was using a msgport that was allocated
  by the main process. Because of this the process could wait forever
  when the printerio request wasn't executed as quickio (TurboPrint).
