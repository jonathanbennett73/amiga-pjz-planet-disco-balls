 Adapted source to compile with ReAction includes
 44.9 apparently did never make it into any update

EditPad 44.11 (1.3.2001)

 Note: When I write (fixes ID ...) this means I already set proper
  status information in the reports database.
 Now does not use the position of the program icon for iconifying
  anymore (fixes ID 2023)
 Added requester when saving a file failed (fixed ID 1513)
 Added requester when loading a file failed

  the complete file or loading a new one (fixes ID 1431 and 1353)
 
EditPad 44.13 (2.3.2001)

 was not able to reproduce hits when loading big files with EditPad,
  probably was fixed some time ago, please test (concerns ID 919 and 1003)
 Redone german EditPad.ct as original one missing here
 "Abbruch" --> "Abbrechen" (fixes part of ID 1088)
 now went through all open bugs I found in the database. If I missed 
  one please point me to its ID 
 since recompile EditPad 44.10 scrollers are not working properly:
   scroller goes garbage on each mouse, asl req or menu related
    GUI update but works fine when moving through the text with
    cursor keys
   This only happens after loading or inserting a file. It does not
    happen when typing empty lines and using the scrollers then.

EditPad 44.14 (3.3.2001)

 bugfix: the vertical scroller was added another time with each "Open"
  (Jochen). This one fixes the scroller issues mentioned in 44.13
  which were introduced with 44.9.
