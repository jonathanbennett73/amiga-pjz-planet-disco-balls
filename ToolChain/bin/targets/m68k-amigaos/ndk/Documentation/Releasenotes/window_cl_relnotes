window.class 44.11 (10.09.99)

 added compatibility kludge

 fixed a bug with positioning of backfill pattern

 enabled fallback font again

 changed some OpenFont() to OpenDiskFont() for fallback font

window.class 45.1 (8.11.2000)

 support for LAYOUT_NoLayout in WM_RETHINK

 if a backfill pattern was used only 1 times changing the prefs would
  reload it. This is avoided now.

window.class 45.2 (11.11.2000)

 setting more than one of the attributes WA_Left, WA_Top, WA_Width,
  WA_Height, WA_InnerWidth and WA_InnerHeight only results in one
  IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW message if the tags follow directly each other.

  The change of this behaviour is not really important but may lead to
  less flickering with some programs after resizing the window by program
  control. Due to some special programming technique AmiDock relies on
  this new behaviour.

window.class 45.3 (13.11.2000)

 WPOS_CENTERMOUSE didn't take left and top offset of screen into account.

 gadget help was messed up.

 windows without size gadget were always minimized on WM_RETHINK or new
  preferences. Windows without size gadget will not be resized anymore
  if one of the size/position tags are once set by the application.

window.class 45.4 (03.03.2001)

 supports VisualPrefs "tbiclass" (for the Iconify image), now.

 fixed placement of the vertical and horizontal border scrollers.

 when calculating the window size the border of the window is taken
  into account, now. This looks better on small displays where the
  fallback font wasn't used even when necessary.

window.class 45.5 (13.03.2001)

 opens titlebar.image when the first object instance is created.

 disabled dithering of background images on 15+bit screens. This
  will give you a slight speed improvement on 15/16 bit screen.

window.class 45.6 (16.04.2001)

 the default backfill pattern (set via ReAction prefs) will be hold
  in memory as long as nobody tries to flush the memory. Before the
  pattern was unloaded as soon as the last instance(s) of window.class
  were disposed. This features is limited to the workbench screen
  and requires workbench.library v45 to work because the pattern has
  to be removed from memory before closing the wb screen (eg. when 
  changing the screen resolution, font etc.).

 window.class automatically closes and reopens all windows that have
  an iconify gadget when intution wants to reset the wb screen. This
  feature also requires wb v45 to work.

window.class 45.7 (26.04.2001)

 messed up the new features by using a function label twice 
  <Mario Cattaneo>.

 when iconifying a window it will remember its position on the screen,
  now <also Mario>.

window.class 45.8 (08.05.2001)

 added a small delay before reopening the windows after a screen close/
  open transition. Without it the color of the light and dark pen (used
  by then xen/thick styles) would be wrong.
  
 flushes the domain cache after a font change, now. The prefs program
  already do this but one can't expect that third-party products also do it.

window.class 45.9 (17.07.2001)

 there was a good chance that window.class crashs on a preferences change
  due to an unintialized list. Thanks to Thomas Richter for tracking
  down the problem.

window.class 45.10 (09.09.2001)

 fixed and documentated SpeedHints (WINDOW_HintInfo).

window.class 45.11 (23.09.2001)

 there were still some hits when using SpeedHints.

window.class 45.12 (09.10.2001)

 reimplemented border scrollers, much better now :)

window.class 45.13 (10.11.2001)

 (un)iconify messages generated by window.class (when Intuition wants to 
  reset the wbscreen) can time-out, now. This avoids that wb gets blocked
  by programs not replying messages (ClassAction).
