commodities.library 44.17 (15.10.2000)

- Ported to SAS/C 6.58, omitting the 'libcode' option.

- Replaced all assembly language code with 'C' code that
  could be replaced.

- Disabled the debugging code.


commodities.library 44.18 (16.10.2000)

- Small, but important change to the library init code.
  Maybe this will cure the erratic open failures.
