BenchTrash 1.51

- Enhanced the error requesters in case a file is not delete-able. BenchTrash 
  presents now additionally the options to skip the file, skip all files or 
  to force undelete the file or files. This means that the delete protection 
  will be removed first before attempting to remove the file. 
- Checked again the error handling in general and improved it somewhat.


BenchTrash 1.52:

- Some minor work on the flickering, requested by Mario.
- Bugfix concering the global trashcan, it didn't move
  icons without files into the trash correctly. 
- Some preparations concerning the new workbench delete
  hook. It is, unfortunately, not yet useable in its
  current form.
- Removed the "Copy first.." gadget as aparently nobody
  understood it anyhow.


BenchTrash 1.53:

- The minor work on flickering turned out to be screwed
  up and broke things completely. Outch. Got fixed.
- BT forgot to clear the "Abort" flag properly from time
  to time, hence, BT aborted future cleanup commands.
- Re-designed the progression bar. It looks now more 
  like the workbench style progression bar.
- Set the MAXAGE by default to zero because nobody would
  understand this feature anyhow and it could confuse
  users.


BenchTrash 1.54:

- BenchTrash did not handle ".info" workbench cache files
  correctly and refused to delete or move them correctly.
- The global trashcan progress bar did not count files and
  directories correctly.
- The global trashcan mode did not check icon files
  correctly, it looked in the wrong directory which could
  have caused wonderful and strange effects. *Shudder*
- The text within the progression bar is now no longer
  drawn in COMPLEMENT mode, but rather with the TEXTPEN.
  This makes this display less effective, though.
- The DOS argument parser was broken and could have thrown
  enforcer hits in case ReadArgs() returned an error.
- Added a new feature: By specifying DELETEFORWB=ON,
  BenchTrash will now hook into the "Dispose" function of
  the workbench.


BenchTrash 1.55:

- BenchTrash deletes now files in case a file within the
  global trashcan was dragged into the trashcan.
- BenchTrash supports now a "delete" qualifier. In case
  either shift key is hold while dragging files over the
  trashcan, BenchTrash will select the "delete" mode.
- BenchTrash multitasks now. BenchTrash launches now 
  background tasks for deleting files, and therefore
  also for the workbench if "DELETEFORWB" is enabled.
  Note that this does *NOT* work for the workbench
  "Empty Trashcan" menu item since it is currently not
  replaced by BenchTrash.


BenchTrash 1.56:

- Due to an oversight, the requester builder never tried
  to localize the requester body. *outch*
- Added more strings to the locale support. BT comes now
  with additional strings for "one drawer" or "more than
  more drawer" as well as "one file" and "more one file"
  plus additional support strings. The "confirmation
  requester" body is then build by these strings to allow
  a more fancy looking requester body. In case a catalog
  does not contain these new items, BT will fall back to
  the old style strings.

BenchTrash 1.57:

- Requester body text generation was still buggy. It did
  not take all arguments into account and therefore
  generated nonsense texts.

BenchTrash 1.58:

- BenchTrash was unable to tell drawers and files apart
  if it was run with DELETEFORWB=ON. This was a side
  effect of the new and different API of the workbench.

BenchTrash 1.59:

- The fix of 1.58 had the side effect that deleting icons
  without an underlying file was broken since no information
  about this file can be inquired for this case. Now
  BenchTrash ignores a file not found error and regards
  these icons as belonging to files.
- Added localizeable keyboard shortcuts for all buttons
  in the control window. This means, again, the locale
  had to grow.

BenchTrash 1.60:

- Fixed an enforcer hit if one of the radio buttons was pressed
  twice. 
- BenchTrash releases now the icon position in case an icon gets
  dropped into it and the global trashcan mode has been selected. 
  This did work already for the "local" mode.

BenchTrash 1.70:

- When in local or mixed mode, BenchTrash did not try to generate
  unique names for the files to be deleted. This got fixed now,
  hopefully. Please test.
- Rewrote the interface completely. BT uses now a Reaction type
  interface.

NOTE: This is not yet for release as too many things changed.
Please test it carefully, especially the new "local mode".

BenchTrash 1.71:

- Layout of the preferences image changed a bit (slightly).
- BT avoids now some flickering on refresh of its gadgets.
- BT renders now the frame in recessed rather in raised mode
  if the icon does not provide a mask. If the icon includes
  a mask, no frame whatsoever is drawn.

BenchTrash 1.72:

- BenchTrash deletion failed in mixed mode for icons without
  underlying files if the corresponding volume contain a trash-
  can. Fixed. <Mario>
- BenchTrash could have reported a garbled error message in the
  above case.

BenchTrash 1.73:

- BenchTrash tries now to setup the progress bar window dimensions
  correctly even for screen fonts whose tx_Width is much smaller
  than the individual width of its characters. This will prevent
  some rendering gliches for "strange" fonts.
