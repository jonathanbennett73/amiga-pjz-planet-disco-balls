PlayCD 44.1 (30.5.99)

- Bumped to V44.

- No longer automatically restarts playback when the entire CD has
  been played. The code now restarts playback only if the repeat
  mode is active.


PlayCD 44.2 (6.6.99)

- Changed the implementation of the code that attempts to read the
  next character from a tcp stream after learning that "0" is a
  perfectly valid return value when reading data from a socket that
  has been closed.

- The code to start playing a title some few seconds into the track
  could end up requesting an MSF offset with a "Seconds" offset > 59.
  Well-behaved drives would handle this gracefully, others I'm not so
  sure about. Anyway, the problem is fixed.


PlayCD 44.3 (9.6.99)

- The eject button now loads/eject media as necessary.


PlayCD 44.4 (10.6.99)

- Rewrote the code that renders the current track name and position.
  Updating the data no longer causes the display to flicker.


PlayCD 44.5 (13.7.99)

- "Stop" no longer does just about the same thing as "Pause"
  [Dirk Harlaar].


PlayCD 44.6 (24.7.99)

- Took out the "Quit" menu. The window close gadget and the
  keyboard equivalents should be sufficient.

- Finally wrote some sort of documentation.


PlayCD 44.7 (27.7.99)

- Program mode now allows more than just a single track to
  be entered, doesn't randomly flip through all titles programmed
  any more and stops after playing the last track.


PlayCD 44.8 (29.7.99)

- In program mode with "Repeat" enabled, playback now restarts with
  the first programmed track.

- The more I've tinkered with the play list code and the playback
  stuff, the unhappier I get about this program design. Someday,
  I'll have to redo it all from scratch in C++...


PlayCD 45.1 (03.11.2000)

- New GUI. Now Reaction, now with skin.

- Falls back to default public screen, if the specified one could
  not be found.

- Option SKIP removed (no longer suitable with the new GUI).

- New option SKIN or SKINDIR to specify the directory, where the skin 
  can be found (default is "Sys:Prefs/Presets/PlayCD/silver").


PlayCD 45.2 (06.11.2000)

- FIX: when inserting the same CD directly after removing it, the
  total duration shown was 00:00.

- Now shows a warning requester, if the specified skin could not be
  found and the default skin is used instead.

- Added some more text for the counter.

- Added an invisible depth-gadget at the location of the Amiga ball.

- Added the ability to search for a CD-ROM in 
  (%|2nd.|3rd.|4th.|5th.|6th.|7th.|8th.)scsi.device
  if hdwrench.library is present and no DOSDEV or DEVICE has been 
  provided.


PlayCD 45.3 (08.11.2000)

- If PlayCD can't find a CD-ROM drive, it does no longer fallback to
  scsi.device, unit 2, but pops up an error-requester instead.

- Added these devices to search for a CD-ROM drive:
  atapi.device, 2060scsi.device, 1260scsi.device, 1230scsi.device,
  cybscsi.device, cybppc.device, z3scsi.device, tekscsi2.device,
  wildfirescsi.device, squirrelscsi.device, oktagon.device, 
  gvpscsi.device, dracoscsi.device.

- Now needs fixed silder.gadget V45.


PlayCD 45.4 (13.11.2000)

- Added dkbscsi.device and blizzppc.device to the devices to search 
  for a CD-ROM drive.

- Added a simple project-menu to quit the program (lost in 45.1).

- Fix: PlayCD crashed, if a nonexistent DOSDEV was provided 
  (came in with 45.2).

- Fix: PlayCD didn't redraw the correct frame of the shuttle animation
  in the upper left corner of the window during a refresh.

- If the automatic search found more than one CD-ROM drive, a `Device'-menu
  is added, where the user can select which device should be used for
  playing.


PlayCD 45.5 (20.11.2000)

- Added omniscsi.device to the devices to search for a CD-ROM drive.


PlayCD 45.6 (27.11.2000)

- Fix: The bitmaps for the animations were not allocted with the screen's
  bitmap as friend, which caused heavy flickering on native Amiga screen
  modes - but it didn't help much.

- Fix: Now using DrawDTObjectA() to draw the ball animation. This way it
  works correctly on AGA 256 color screens, too.


PlayCD 45.7 (22.03.2001)

- Fix: Changed SCSI INQUIRY size to 56 bytes. This way it should work with
  omniscsi.device and old gvpscsi.device, too.


PlayCD 45.8 (07.08.2001)

- Added CDDB-support by using the cddb.library.


PlayCD 45.9 (28.09.2001)

- Added support for the whole Amiga character table for printing
  CDDB data.
