HDToolbox 44.1 (22.6.99)

 Added version string and bumprevision control

 If HDToolbox is run with one WB argument (project icon) the tooltypes are
  read from this project icon. This allows to have different projects for
  many SCSI boards.

 New tooltype and cli arg ASKDEVICE opens a device list with all open
  devices. The user selects one of the devices which is used for scanning
  the SCSI bus. Attention: This may crash the machine if an illegal device
  is selected.

HDToolbox 44.2 (23.06.99)

 In case of ASKDEVICE the device list now only contains devices that are
  in use for a filesystem and support ACTION_DISK_INFO. This shows devices
  like ramdrive.device also but selecting one of these devices should not
  break the system.
  
  The exec devices list should also be scanned for such devices to
  support boards that are not initialized yet. How?
  
  The DEVS: devices should also be scanned for trackdisk devices. How?

 The device list is sorted alphabetical.

HDToolbox 44.3 (25.06.99)

 Changed GUI. Now it does need less than 640 pixel width with topaz/8.

 If "Install drive" finds a RDB the user is asked to edit this RDB or
to create a new one. This allows to install drives with broken RDBs which
are not recognized broken by hdwrench.library

HDToolbox 44.6 (27.7.99)

 Adapted to hdwrench V44.100

 After a lot of chrashes and endless loops I stopped all tests to use
  the NDS features to select usefull devices with option ASKDEVICE. Now
  all devices that are used with a drive and all devices in memory which
  do not mach a exclusion-list are presented to the user.

 Cursor-Left and Cursor-Right may be used to browse through the partitions.
  Usefull if a partition is very small.

 The drive scanning should now work with devices that uses unique names
  for each board (scsi.device, 2nd.scsi.device ...) and devices which
  expects the board number in the unit number (100 * board + ...)

 Should now recognize drives with addresses or LUNs larger 7 on wide scsi
  boards.

 If the user cancels the change-flag question it is not longer repeated
  until exiting HDToolBox

 Fixed and changed algortihm to change the LAST#? flags. All drives accept
  Type 0 and 7 are ignored.

 Fixed window title

 Added automatic stack extension at startup

 Changing a RDB now differs between minor and major changes

 Destroying data on partitions now lists all destroyed partitions before
  saving RDB

 Starting HDToolBox from WB without tooltype DEVICE_NAME caused a lot of
  hits because there was no default devicename set. Now "scsi.device" is the
  default.

HDToolbox 44.8 (5.8.99)

 Added callback for scanning drives. Not working yet due to problems with
  hdwrench.library V44.102

 Reference labels for partition gadgets now uses the different patterns.

 Above partition gadget the first and last cylinder is displayed

 adapted units (K, M, G) to Workbench.

 only drives with type 0 or 7 are editable anymore. An error message pops
  up for all other or unknown drive types.

 Added tooltype MFSAVEPATH which is used in saving mountfiles for saving
  filesystems and drive init code. Default is "SYS": which is replaced
  by hdwrench with L: for filesystems and DEVS: for drive init code. Use
  an empty string to save to same location as mountfile.

 fixed a bug with extended error messages (drive parameter were trashed)

 string.gadget doesn't except strings that have exactly the size of the 
  buffer (including NUL char). Increased size of buffer.

 still problems with loading back saved RDB files. Mountfiles seems to work
  now.

HDToolbox 44.9 (9.8.99)

 fixed wrong device name prefixes

 faster scanning of devices and boards

 calculating pointer addresses from block numbers in RDB were wrong.

 added better test for existing devices while scanning

HDToolbox 44.10 (12.8.99)

 Changed layout a bit to make sure the window can be opened on 640x200 with
  different bevel styles and topaz/8.

 Fixed a sign extension bug from reading BCPL strings.

 enabled callback hook. You must use hdwrench V44.104 or the drive list will 
  be empty.

HDToolbox 44.11 (20.9.99)

 MaxChars of some string gadgets were too small (bug in STRGCLASS)

 rdb_RGBBlocksLo was not added to block numbers before saving RDB blocks.

 Calling QueryCapacity() for SCSI types != 0 or 7 is not a good idea. The
  capacity is now given as "Unknown" for tapes, scanners, etc.
  
 Checking validity of RDBs by comparing result of QueryCapacity and RDB
  irritated beta testers too much.

 Edit hook for hex numbers was too restrictive (RAmiga-X didn't work).

퇏If a partition was a little bit changed (like DMA mask or number of
  buffers) the "Reboot" dialog was opened at exit.

HDToolbox 44.12 (20.9.99)

 Changing the visible gadget page may change the window size. This cannot
  be fixed.

 Updating a filesystem modified DOS Type. Fixed.

HDToolbox 44.13 (22.9.99)

 Ups, forgot to fix the catalog name (Sys/hdtoolbox.catalog).

HDToolbox 44.14 (23.9.99)

 added more devices to the ASKDEVICE exclusion list. 

ATTENTION: cybppc.device is added to the exclusion list. I'm afraid it 
cannot be handled by HDToolbox. If you try, wired things happen. You still
can use this and all other devices from the exclusion list by selectem the
device via tooltype.

 The icon name for iconify icon is now the filename of the program.

 A new partition name was only stored if left pressing [Return].

 fixed one enforcer hit if "Cancel" was pressen in select-device page.

 HDToolbox should now fit on a 640x200 screen if catalog does not contain
  to long strings.

HDToolbox 44.15 (27.9.99)

 File system name on partition page was not updated after changing the 
  type.

 Updating a FilesystemHeaderBlock which did not contain a filesystem
  file name replaced the identifier with default one. This bug was  by
  "Bad Coding Style Company".

HDToolbox 44.16 (28.9.99)

 Fixed enforcer hits when quitting.

 Opening window from iconify state did not reattach the menu strip to window.

HDToolbox 44.17 (29.9.99)

 returning from "Change..." or "Add/Update..." filesystem selected first
  partition again.

HDToolbox 44.18 (1.10.99)

 cybscsi.device is added to the exclusion list.

--- OS 3.5 release ---

HDToolbox 44.19 (17.11.99)

퇏added a lot of GA_TabCycle tags

퇏changed the LAST#? flag handling a bit.

HDToolbox 44.20 (29.11.99)

 increased default buffers to 80. Is this enough?

 "Automount partition" checkbox uses a wrong tag so it didn't response useful
  to mouse events.

퇏default blocksize is now 1024 for drives with physical blocksize 512. Drives
  with larger physical blocksize (eg 2048) still use the same value as the
  physical blocksize.

HDToolbox 44.21 (6.12.99)

 default MaxTransfer is set to 0x1fe00 to avoid data crashes

HDToolbox 44.22 (7.12.99)

 removed cybppc.device and cypscsi.device from forbid-list of devices.

 added hyperCOM3Z.device to forbid-list.

--- Boing Bag 1 ---

HDToolbox 44.23 (4.11.2000)

 added "Envoy FS" to the list of forbidden devices.

 fix: the number of entries in Env table is not longer the size of the C
  structure but the correct number of entries. HDTB still differs between
  bootable (19 entries) and non bootable (16 entries) partitions. Not really
  important I think.

 If finding default values of a drive returns an error the function call is
  done a seconds time without the optimization flag set. I always thought
  hdwrench.library does this fallback automatically.

--- OS 3.9 release ---

HDToolbox 44.24 (6.11.2000)

 added ahi.device to forbid-list

 vendor string is now filled with unknown + 21 spaces before calling 
  FindDiskName. This should at least give a valid name if the disk name
  cannot be read at all.

HDToolbox 44.25 (7.11.2000)

 added more devices to forbid-list (hyperCOM#?, hyperPAR#?, vmcisdn#?,
  tpspool#?). Added pattern matching for more complex device names.

 one menu item was enabled in partition page. Saving a mountlist of a single
  partition was planned for OS 3.5 but never supported by hdwrench.library.
  Now the menu item is disabled too (and so the full menu).

HDToolbox 44.26 (14.11.2000)

 added multidisk.device, vdisk.device and silversurfer.device to forbid-list.

 changed "Load RDB..." to "Load RDB From File..." and "Save RDB..." to
  "Save RDB To File...".

HDToolbox 44.27 (12.12.2000)

 fixed enforcer hit when deleting partition or clicking into empty space
  on drive.

HDToolbox 44.28 (19.12.2000)

 added sanamni.device to the forbidden device list

 Appicon for iconify is now unsnapped after loading

HDToolbox 45.1 (19.12.00)

 dumped to V 45.

HDToolbox 45.2 (21.12.2000)

 added iobelix(par|ser).device

 added fd.device

 added iosterix(par|ser).device. I know this devices do not exist. But due
  to Joanne Dow I had to add them as partners for iobelix.
