ConClip 44.1 (8.8.99)

- Ported to SAS/C 6.59

- Removed the icky segment split trick. The startup
  code no longer fiddles with the program's segment
  list but detaches it "cleanly" from the parent CLI.


ConClip 44.2 (8.8.99)

- Folded clipboard support for string gadgets into the
  program. ConClip will now install a front end for the
  default Intuition string gadget editing hook which
  watches for [Right Amiga]+c (= copy) and [Right Amiga]+v
  (= paste) events. For the copy case, the contents of the
  string gadget will be extracted and stored in the clipboard.
  For the paste case, the current contents of the clipboard
  will be extracted and inserted at the current cursor
  position. The code is smart enough to watch for buffer
  overflow and will insert only as many characters as will
  fit into the string gadget. Integer gadgets are handled
  transparently since they are "only" a special case of
  string gadget.

  NOTE: [Right Amiga]+c will trigger the copy function,
        [Right Amiga]+[Shift]+c will insert the upper
        case character "C" (or trigger a menu item if
        a clever custom string gadget editing hook is
        attached to the respective string gadget). The
        same holds true for [Right Amiga]+[Shift]+v.


ConClip 44.3 (22.9.99)

- Changed the priority ConClip adds its MsgPort with
  (bumped to 1).
