string.gadget 45.0 (04.10.00) - (20.10.00)

- first release for os3.5 beta-testers [2000-10-04].

- RAMIGA+q was implemented as RAMIGA+Q (see doc). if the
  gadget doesn't understand a key (combination), the global
  edit hook of intuition will be called. this way tools
  like NewEdit, BetterString, StringSnip, etc. are supported
  by this class. now reads env:sys/icontrol.prefs to check whether
  the user has enabled the "Text Gadget Filter" option (see doc/
  control keys). [2000-10-09].
      
- Fixed byte-read from #0 enforcer hit when initialising the gadget,
  RAMIGA+TAB was interpreted as TAB <Mario Cattaneo> [2000-10-10]
      
- implemented simple undo and redo (RAMIGA+z/Z). the marked text
  will be drawn using the FILLPEN and FILLTEXTPEN (blue and black),
  now <Mario Cattaneo>. pressing CTRL/RAMIGA+TAB brings up a file
  requester, now (no auto-completion yet). a few changes, not 
  really worth to mention :) [2000-10-20]


string.gadget 45.1 (27.10.00)

- implemented filename completion. removed filerequester code, this
  makes the code simpler and safer. 
   
- allocates memory from a memory pool, now.

- added some additonal tags to the API that might be useful for
  developers.
  

string.gadget 45.2 (01.11.00)

- paste (RAMIGA+v) works even when the gadget is in password mode,
  now <Mario Cattaneo>.

- the bevel.image didn't erase its background, so that you could
  see the backfill image of the window inside the gadget box.

- when reaching the last matching name, the filename completion (FNC)
  starts over (cycles back to the first match) <Allan Odgaard>.

- the FNC sorts the list of matches, now. <Allan Odgaard>.

- instead of acting on the entire word, ramiga-shift-g starts from
  the cursor position <Allan Odgaard>.

- if a number isn't under the cursor, ramiga +/- and ramiga $/# search
  backward for the number <Allan Odgaard>.
  
- the FNC adds a space to the end of filenames, now <Allan Odggard>.

- implemented SHK_HOTKEY hook for Doc. Richter. 

- some numpad keys were filtered out by the gadget, fixed.

- ramiga i/d can be used as an alternative to ramiga +/i, now <again Allan>.


string.gadget 45.3 (05.11.00)

- SHK_HOTKEY detects qualifiers (shift,alt,control,command), now.

- deleting a block by pressing backspace didn't work when the cursor
  was at the beginning of the string (an 'if' at the wrong place)
  <Allan Odgaard>.

- pressing backspace twice in a SHK_HOTKEY gadget deletes its contents.
  <Allan Odgaard>.
  
- changed the SHK_PASSWORD hook to do nothing. the GM_RENDER method is 
  responsible to hide the password, now. this is much easier than messing
  around with the buffers.

- pressing "ramiga shift c" appends the (marked) text to the clipboard 
  <Allan Odgaard>.

- when FNC is used and there's only one matching name, pressing ramiga/ctrl
  and tab again will enter the directory <Allan Odgaard>.

- ramiga+x doesn't copy the erased text to the clipboard anymore (as long
  as it isn't marked) <Gabriele Favrin>.
  
- now places the cursor at the end of the string when the gadget is activated
  by ActivateGadget() right after OM_NEW <Gabriele Favrin>.

- no longer needs to read icontrol.prefs to see whether the user has enabled
  the "Text Gadget Filter" option of IControl. Thanks to Olaf, the IPrefs
  (>45.2) semaphore has this information handy.

- the SHINEPEN is now used to draw the cursor <Allan Odgaard>.

- as long as the programmer does not specify any other pens, the background
  pen of the *active* gadget is the xen/HALFSHINE pen, now <Allan Odgaard>.

- (wordwise) marking still worked even when it was requested to be disabled.


string.gadget 45.4 (10.11.00)

- quicksorts the FNC list, now.

- implemented GM_CLIPRECT (based on the integer.gadget sources).

- the cursor has the same width as the 'n' when it isn't over a character.
  <Allan Odgaard>.

- StringInfo->LongInt wasn't updated by every operation (paste, increase/decrease).

- setting either STRINGA_TextVal or STRINGA_LongVal forces a refresh, now.
  <Jochen Becher>

- the GM_DOMAIN method takes care that BEVEL_VertSize is BEVEL_HorizSize and
  that BEVEL_HorizSize is BEVEL_VertSize :) the fixes the problem that the
  gadget was to tall (depending on the bevel style selected in ReAction prefs).
  <Pavel Narozny>

- the disabled pattern wasn't drawn at the right position and size
  <Massimo Tantignone>.


string.gadget 45.5 (15.11.00)

- the GM_HANDLEINPUT method doesn't return GMR_NEXTACTIVE or GMR_PREVACTIVE
  anymore when GFLG_TABCYCLE is not set.
  

string.gadget 45.6 (17.11.00)

- fixed a few bugs in string editing.

- the width returned by the GM_DOMAIN method is a bit larger, now.


string.gadget 45.7 (22.11.00)

- the inner spacing btw the left/right border and the text is 2 pixels, again.


string.gadget 45.7 (27.11.00)

- the version string contained the wrong revision number.


string.gadget 45.8 (09.12.00)

- the entire bevel.image is filled up with the bg colour, now.

- the strncpy() function could copy one char more than allowed to
  the buffer. Ouch!


string.gadget 45.9 (26.12.00)

- jumping to the next/previous word skips all delimiters between two
  words, now <Allan Odgaard>.


string.gadget 45.10 (05.03.01)

- some small changes, nothing worth to mention ...


string.gadget 45.11 (11.03.01)

- can be used by listbrowser.gadget for node editing, now.


string.gadget 45.12 (26.03.01)

- added a Forbid()/Permit() where it was missing <Thomas Richter>.


string.gadget 45.13 (15.03.01)

- when activating the gadget via Activate(Layout)Gadget() while the
  user holds down the left mouse button, no longer triggers cursor
  movements.


string.gadget 45.14 (06.08.01)

- disabled notification of attributes changes done via OM_SET/UPDATE.
  This matches the behaviour of the standard (ROM) BOOPSI classes.


string.gadget 45.15 (06.10.01)

- instead of treating the entire string as a pathname, the FNC
  "grabs" the pathpart from the string and completes it <Mario Cattaneo>.
