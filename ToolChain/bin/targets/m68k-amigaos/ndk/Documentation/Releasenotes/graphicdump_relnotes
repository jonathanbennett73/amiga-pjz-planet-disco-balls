- Bumped to V44.

- Removed the copyright text.


GraphicDump 44.2 (13.8.99)

- Rewritten from scratch.

- Now uses the ReadArgs() parser and requires Kickstart 2.04.

- Added an option to choose the printer.device unit to be used.

- Now complains about printing and setup errors.

- While the initial delay is ticking, ^C will stop GraphicDump
  before it has started the printout.


GraphicDump 44.3 (15.8.99)

- Now makes a bold attempt to lock the screen currently being
  printed, if that screen is a public screen.

- Reset the page scaling values to match the documentation.

- Updated the documentation, or what was supposed to be a
  documentation for the original GraphicDump program (back then,
  called "VersaDump").
