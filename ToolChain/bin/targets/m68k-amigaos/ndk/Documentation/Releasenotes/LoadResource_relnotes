LoadResource 45.1 (19.1.2001)

- Bumped to V45.
- LoadSeg patch was broken. It trashed the registers d2-d3 which
  are used by the overlayed version of LoadSeg.
- Forbid()/Permit() protection around SetFunction() was missing.
- A dos AnchorPath was allocated on the stack. This does not
  guarantee long word alignment as desired. The anchor path is
  now moved into the global data including an __aligned to 
  fix this. Optimally, it should be allocated by AllocDosObject(),
  but the current implementation of LoadResource() must be re-
  designed to contain allow proper error handling in case this
  allocation would fail. "Never catch an error you don't know
  how to handle". (-;
- In case the init code opened only some of the libraries, the
  code forgot to close the remaining.
- The code uses now SysBase instead of AbsExecBase.

Additional remarks: The implementation of LoadResource() is
questionable. It installs an - completely unnecessary - patch
into LoadSeg() to be able to pre-load segments. I have some
ideas how to avoid this patch party by an Os friendly approach,
but this would require somewhat more work. Conclusion:

		****Avoid this program****
