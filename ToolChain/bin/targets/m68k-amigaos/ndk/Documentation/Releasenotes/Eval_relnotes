	Eval 45.1

- Complete rewrite of the old eval program, no old sources
  have been used.
  Added a lot of new operators (^,&&,||,>=,<=,==,!=,<>,^,!)
  fixed priority of operators, added the HEX switch, fixed
  LFORMAT double-% bug, added more format string options for
  LFORMAT. Eval did not handle multiple arguments for "VALUE2"
  properly and in fact ignored all but the first.

	Eval 45.2

- Eval accepts now the TAB character as blank.
