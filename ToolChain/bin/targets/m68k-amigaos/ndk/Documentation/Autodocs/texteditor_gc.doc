texteditor.gadget is a fast multiline stringgadget. It can hold quite large texts
without noticeable slowdowns. It supports the clipboard, it can show text with
different styles, alignments and colors. It can hold separators, it has
multilevel undo/redo and it can easily be configured to use an external spell
checker for type'n'spell and word guessing.
texteditor.gadget/GA_TEXTEDITOR_AreaMarked

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_AreaMarked -- [..G], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        This tag will be set to TRUE when text is marked. And back to
        FALSE when nothing is marked.
        You can create a notifyevent with this tag and let your cut/copy
        buttons become ghosted when nothing is marked.

texteditor.gadget/GA_TEXTEDITOR_ColorMap

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_ColorMap -- [IS.], LONG *

    FUNCTION
        This is a map of allocated colors, which corresponds to the pen number
        you set with GA_TEXTEDITOR_Pen.
        By default the map looks like this:

           0 = Normal (user configured text/highlight color)
           1 = Shine
           2 = Halfshine
           3 = Background
           4 = Halfshadow
           5 = Shadow
           6 = Text
           7 = Fill
           8 = Mark
           9 = Screen pen 0
          10 = Screen pen 1
          11 = Screen pen 3
          .. = ...
         255 = Screen pen 246

        If you supply your own colormap, then pen value 0 will still be
        "Normal", i.e. the first entry in your colormap has pen value 1.
        This may seem a bit illogical, suggest an alternative if you want!

        You are allowed to dynamically change the colormap. However if you
        change an entry which is on-screen, then it won't have any immediate
        effect. The idea is that you should e.g. supply a colormap with 16
        unused LONGs, allow the user to select a custom color, allocate that
        color and store the screen pen value into the colormap. Now you can
        use that entry as argument to GA_TEXTEDITOR_Pen.

        Have in mind that your application may change screen, so the best
        place to allocate/free colors are in the MUIM_Show and MUIM_Hide
        methods of the editorgadget. An example of this can be found in
        TextEditor-Demo.c

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_Contents -- [IS.], APTR

    FUNCTION
        Set the contents of this gadget. This should normally be a pointer to
        a text buffer, but if you have supplied your own importhook, then you
        can set this to anything you like, e.g. a filehandle.

texteditor.gadget/GA_TEXTEDITOR_CursorX

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_CursorX -- [ISG], ULONG

    FUNCTION
        You can get or set the cursors x position with this tag.
        The first character on a line has position 0.
        The position is not affected by the gadgets `autowrap' feature.
        If you set a value higher than the length of the current line, then
        it will automatically be truncated.

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_CursorY -- [ISG], ULONG

    FUNCTION
        You can get or set the cursors y position with this tag.
        The first line has position 0.
        The position is not affected by the gadgets `autowrap' feature.
        If you set a value higher than the number of lines, then it will
        automatically be truncated.

texteditor.gadget/GA_TEXTEDITOR_DoubleClickHook

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_DoubleClickHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    FUNCTION
        If you use the gadget in ReadOnly mode then you may want a special
        action to take place when the user doubleclick certain words.
        For example a mail or news client, using this gadget to show mails,
        may want the user to be able to click on URL's to lookup the link.

        The hook will be called with A1 pointing to a ClickMessage, and A0
        will point to the hook itself.
        Your hook should return TRUE if it wants to stop the editor from
        blocking.

    EXAMPLE
        /* This hook will test if the user doubleclicked an http address */

        BOOL URLHookCode (register __a1 struct ClickMessage *clickmsg)
        {
              UWORD pos = clickmsg->ClickPosition;

           while(pos && *(clickmsg->LineContents+pos-1) != ' ' && *(clickmsg->LineContents+pos-1) != '<')
           {
              pos--;
           }

           if(strncmp(clickmsg->LineContents+pos, "http:", 5))
           {
              return(FALSE);
           }
           LookupURL(clickmsg->LineContents+pos);
           return(TRUE);
        }

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_ExportHook_EMail
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_ExportHook_Plain (default)

    FUNCTION
        The EMail export hook will convert a bold word to *bold*, italic
        words to /italic/ and underlined words to _underline_.
        It also export separators such as <sb> or <tsb>.

        See GA_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook for more documentation.

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_ExportWrap -- [ISG], ULONG

    FUNCTION
        This attribute allows the builtin export hooks to perform wordwrap.
        Zero means no wrap (default).

    SEE ALSO

texteditor.gadget/GA_TEXTEDITOR_FixedFont

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_FixedFont -- [I.G], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        This attribute is not supported by the Reaction version of texteditor.gadget.
        Use GA_TextAttr to set a fixed font.

texteditor.gadget/GA_TEXTEDITOR_Flow

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_Flow -- [.SG], UWORD

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_Flow_Left
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_Flow_Right
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_Flow_Center
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_Flow_Justified (not yet implemented)

    FUNCTION
        Set/get the current paragraphs alignment.
        If an area is marked while you set this attribute, then the new
        alignment will be set for the complete area.

texteditor.gadget/GA_TEXTEDITOR_HasChanged

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_HasChanged -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
        This tag will show if the contents of the gadget has changed.
        You can take notify on this tag, so that you can connect it with a
        checkmark or textobject.
        You should set this tag to FALSE whenever you export the contents of
        the gadget or overwrite it with something new.

        Even though you have set up notification on this tag you should
        still get() it before you kill the text, because this makes it
        possible to do some advanced testing to see if the text has actually
        been modified. E.g. by checking the undobuffer, comparing checksums
        or by checking whether or not the textbuffer is empty (none of this
        is currently done, but it may be in the future).

        The tag is currently not affected by:
         GA_TEXTEDITOR_Contents, GM_TEXTEDITOR_ClearText
         GM_TEXTEDITOR_Export, GM_TEXTEDITOR_Import

texteditor.gadget/GA_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook

    NAME
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook -- [IS.], struct Hook *

    SPECIAL INPUTS
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook_EMail
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook_MIME
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook_MIMEQuoted
        GV_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook_Plain (default)

    FUNCTION
        Since this gadget allows different text styles, you can supply an
        importhook to parse the text correctly.

        The default importhook understands the following escape sequences:

         <ESC> + u      Set the soft style to underline.
         <ESC> + b      Set the soft style to bold.
         <ESC> + i      Set the soft style to italic.
         <ESC> + n      Set the soft style back to normal.
         <ESC> + h      Highlight the current line.
         <ESC> + p[x]   Change to color x, where x is taken from the colormap.
                        0 means normal. The color is reset for each new line.

             The following sequences are only valid at the beginning of a line.

         <ESC> + l      Left justify current and following lines.
         <ESC> + r      Right justify current and following lines.
         <ESC> + c      Center current and following lines.
         <ESC> + [s:x]  Create a separator. x is a bit combination of flags:
                         Placement (mutually exclusive):
                           1 = Top
                           2 = Middle
                           4 = Bottom
                         Cosmetical:
                           8 = StrikeThru   - Draw separator ontop of text.
                          16 = Thick        - Make separator extra thick.


          GV_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook_MIME:

        This builtin hook will convert quoted-printables (e.g. "=E5") to the
        ASCII representation, and merge lines ending with a "=", it will
        wordwrap the text (using the value set with
        GA_TEXTEDITOR_ImportWrap), it will highlight all lines which start
        with ">" it will make real *bold*, /italic/, _underline_ and
        #colored#, and it will replace <sb> or <tsb> with a real separator
        bar. It stops parsing when it reaches a NULL byte.

        The color used for #colored# text is colormap entry 6, which defaults
        to MPEN_FILL. To override it, just supply a colormap with entry 6 set
        to whatever color you would like.


          GV_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook_MIMEQuoted:

        Like the MIME importhook, but each line gets quoted and highlighted.


          GV_TEXTEDITOR_ImportHook_EMail:

        Like the MIME importhook, but it doesn't convert quoted printables.


        You can of course create your own importhook, there is an external
        file which describes the procedure.

    NOTE
        Don't use custom hooks yet.

        GM_TEXTEDITOR_ARexxCmd

    SYNOPSIS
        DoGadgetMethod(obj, win, req, GM_TEXTEDITOR_ARexxCmd, NULL, STRPTR command);

    FUNCTION
        If the user spends much of his time in the TextEditor gadget, then he
        may want to have the gadgets functions integrated in the programs
        arexx command set.
        This can easily be done with this method, simply call it with the
        command that the user has executed. If the method returns something
        else than FALSE, then the command has been used by the gadget. If it
        does return FALSE, then you should parse the command yourself.

        This method can also be used by you, to communicate with the gadget.

        The following commands are currently supported:

           CLEAR
           CUT

    RESULT
        The method will return FALSE if it couldn't use the command.
        It will return TRUE if it did use the command, but the command didn't
        give a result. It will return a pointer (STRPTR) when the command
        gives a result, you should return this pointer to the user
        (CreateArgString() it, and set it as the result, in the rexx message),
        you must free the result yourself with FreeVec()

    SYNOPSIS
        DoGadgetMethod(obj, win, req, GM_TEXTEDITOR_ExportText, NULL);

    FUNCTION
        This will export the text using the current exporthook.

    RESULT
        This depends on the exporthook. The builtin hooks will return a
        pointer to a null terminated buffer containing all the text. You must
        free this buffer with FreeVec() when you are done using it.

texteditor.gadget/GM_TEXTEDITOR_HandleError

    NAME
        GM_TEXTEDITOR_HandleError

    SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj, win, req, GM_TEXTEDITOR_InsertText, ULONG errorcode);

    FUNCTION
        This method is not supported by the editorgadget itself. The idea is
        that you should subclass the gadget and implement your own error
        handler. The handler should just bring up a requester or write the
        error in a status line.

        The different errors are:

        Error_ClipboardIsEmpty:        The clipboard doesn't hold any data.
        Error_ClipboardIsNotFTXT:      The clipboard doesn't hold any text.
        Error_MacroBufferIsFull:       Not yet used.
        Error_MemoryAllocationFailed:  Not yet used.
        Error_NoAreaMarked:            The user has tried to copy or cut, but
                                       hasn't marked anything.
        Error_NoMacroDefined:          Not yet used.
        Error_NothingToRedo:           There is nothing more to redo.
        Error_NothingToUndo:           There is nothing more to undo.
        Error_NotEnoughUndoMem:        The user has erased a block that is too
                                       big to be saved. This results in a lost
                                       undobuffer.
        Error_StringNotFound:          Not yet used.

    RESULT

    FUNCTION
        This method replace the marked area with the string given.
        Currently no flags are defined, so pass 0L for now.

    RESULT
        TRUE if the string was replaced. A failure is likely to be because
        nothing was marked when this method got invoked.

texteditor.gadget/GM_TEXTEDITOR_Search

    NAME
        OM_TEXTEDITOR_Search

    SYNOPSIS
        DoGadgetMethod(obj, win, req, OM_TEXTEDITOR_Search, NULL, STRPTR string, ULONG flags);

    FUNCTION
        Searches the text for the given string. The string mustn't exceed 120
        characters.

        Flags can be:

         GF_TEXTEDITOR_Search_FromTop
          Normally the search starts at the cursor position - this flag will
          make it start at the beginning of the text.

         GF_TEXTEDITOR_Search_CaseSensitive
          If you want the search to be case sensitive, then set this flag.

    RESULT
        TRUE if the string was found, otherwise FALSE.

    NOTE
        If the string was found then it's left marked. So in case you want to
        replace it, simply clear the marked string and insert the new one.
