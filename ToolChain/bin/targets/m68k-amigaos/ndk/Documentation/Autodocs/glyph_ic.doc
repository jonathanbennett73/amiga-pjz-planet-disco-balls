    NAME
        glyph_ic -- create glyph BOOPSI objects

    SUPERCLASS
        imageclass

    REQUIRES
        drawlist.image

    DESCRIPTION
        This image class can create scaled glyphs suitable for use
        as gadget imagery or informational requestor imagery.
        Either a penmap or drawlist scaled image is created internally,
        and external user prefered glyph style sets may become possible
        at a later date.

    METHODS
        OM_NEW -- Create the glyph image. Passed to superclass, then OM_SET.

        OM_GET -- Get object attributes. Passed to superclass first.

        OM_SET -- Set object attributes.
            Passed to superclass first.

        OM_UPDATE -- Set object notification attributes. Passed to
            superclass first.

        IM_DRAW -- Renders the image. Overrides the superclass.

        IM_DRAWFRAME -- Renders the image scaled to fit in the frame.
            Following IM_DRAW will be this size. Overrides the superclass.

        All other methods are passed to the superclass.

glyph_ic/GLYPH_GetClass                            glyph_ic/GLYPH_GetClass

    NAME
        GLYPH_GetClass -- Gets the pointer to the glyph class.

    SYNOPSIS
        glyph_class = GLYPH_GetClass();
        D0

        Class * GLYPH_GetClass(VOID);

    FUNCTION
        Obtains the pointer to the Glyph image class for use with
        NewObject().  This function always returns a valid pointer so
        you do not need to check it.  The reason is that if the library
        opens fine, then the pointer returned is already setup.  (Of course
        this implies that if opening the library fails, you shouldn't be
        calling this.)

        Note that this function does not create the class, that is done
        when the class library is opened.

    INPUTS
        Nothing.

    RESULT
        glyph_class - Pointer to the Glyph image class.
