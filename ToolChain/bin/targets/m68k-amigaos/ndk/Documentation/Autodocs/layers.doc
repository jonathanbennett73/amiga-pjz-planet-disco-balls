    NAME
	BeginUpdate -- Prepare to repair damaged layer.

    SYNOPSIS
	result = BeginUpdate( l )
	d0                    a0

	LONG BeginUpdate( struct Layer *);

    FUNCTION
	Convert damage list to ClipRect list and swap in for
	programmer to redraw through. This routine simulates
	the ROM library environment. The idea is to only render in the
	"damaged" areas, saving time over redrawing all of the layer.
	The layer is locked against changes made by the layer library.

    INPUTS
	l - pointer to a layer

    RESULTS
	result - TRUE if damage list converted to ClipRect list successfully.
	         FALSE if list conversion aborted. (probably out of memory)

    BUGS
	If BeginUpdate returns FALSE, programmer must abort the attempt to
	refresh this layer and instead call EndUpdate( l, FALSE ) to restore
	original ClipRect and damage list.

	EndUpdate(), graphics/layers.h, graphics/clip.h

layers.library/BehindLayer                         layers.library/BehindLayer

    NAME
	BehindLayer -- Put layer behind other layers.

    SYNOPSIS
	result = BehindLayer( dummy, l )
	d0                    a0     a1

	LONG BehindLayer( LONG, struct Layer *);

    FUNCTION
	Move this layer to the most behind position swapping bits
	in and out of the display with other layers.
	If other layers are REFRESH then collect their damage lists and
	set the LAYERREFRESH bit in the Flags fields of those layers that
	may be revealed.  If this layer is a backdrop layer then
	put this layer behind all other backdrop layers.
	If this layer is NOT a backdrop layer then put in front of the
	top backdrop layer and behind all other layers.

	Note: this operation may generate refresh events in other layers
	   associated with this layer's Layer_Info structure.

    INPUTS
	dummy - unused
	l - pointer to a layer

    RESULTS
	result - TRUE    if operation successful
	         FALSE   if operation unsuccessful (probably out of memory)

    FUNCTION
	Create a new Layer of position and size (x0,y0)->(x1,y1)
	Make this layer of type found in flags.
	Install Layer->BackFill callback Hook.
	If SuperBitMap, use bm2 as pointer to real SuperBitMap,
	and copy contents of Superbitmap into display layer.
	If this layer is a backdrop layer then place it behind all
	other layers including other backdrop layers. If this is
	not a backdrop layer then place it behind all nonbackdrop
	layers.

	Note: when using SUPERBITMAP, you should also set LAYERSMART flag.

    INPUTS
	li - pointer to LayerInfo structure
	bm - pointer to common BitMap used by all Layers
	x0,y0 - upper left hand corner of layer
	x1,y1 - lower right hand corner of layer

    NAME
	DoHookClipRects - Do the given hook for each of the ClipRects    (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	DoHookClipRects(hook,rport,rect)
	                a0   a1    a2

	void DoHookClipRects(struct Hook *,struct RastPort *,struct Rectangle *);

    FUNCTION
	This function will call the given hook for each cliprect in the
	layer that can be rendered into.  This is how the backfill hook
	in Layers is implemented.  This means that hidden simple-refresh
	cliprects will be ignored.  It will call the SuperBitMap cliprects,
	smart refresh off-screen cliprects, and all on screen cliprects.
	If the rect parameter is not NULL, the cliprects are bounded to
	the rectangle given.

    INPUTS
	hook - pointer to layer callback Hook which will be called
	       with object == (struct RastPort *) result->RastPort
	       and message == [ (Layer *) layer, (struct Rectangle) bounds,
	                        (LONG) offsetx, (LONG) offsety ]

	       This hook should fill the Rectangle in the RastPort
	       with the BackFill pattern appropriate for offset x/y.

	       If hook is LAYERS_BACKFILL, the default backfill is
	       used for the layer.

	       If hook is LAYERS_NOBACKFILL, the layer will not be
	       backfilled (NO-OP).

	rport- A pointer to the RastPort that is to be operated on.
	       This function will lock the layer if the RastPort is
	       layered...
	       If the rport is non-layered your hook will be called with
	       the rectangle as passed, the RastPort, and a NULL layer...

	rect - The bounding rectangle that should be used on the layer.
	       This rectangle "clips" the cliprects to the bound given.
	       If this is NULL, no bounding will take place.
	       *MUST* not be NULL if the RastPort is non-layered!

    NOTES
	The RastPort you are passed back is the same one passed to the
	function.  You should *not* use "layered" rendering functions
	on this RastPort.  Generally, you will wish to do BitMap operations
	such as BltBitMap().  The callback is a raw, low-level rendering
	call-back.  If you need to call a rendering operation with a
	RastPort, make sure you use a copy of the RastPort and NULL the
	Layer pointer.

    NAME
	EndUpdate -- remove damage list and restore state of layer to normal.

    SYNOPSIS
	EndUpdate( l, flag )
	           a0  d0

	void EndUpdate( struct Layer *, UWORD);

    FUNCTION
	After the programmer has redrawn his picture he calls this
	routine to restore the ClipRects to point to his standard
	layer tiling. The layer is then unlocked for access by the
	layer library.

	Note: use flag = FALSE if you are only making a partial update.
	    You may use the other region functions (graphics functions such as
	    OrRectRegion, AndRectRegion, and XorRectRegion ) to clip adjust
	    the DamageList to reflect a partial update.

    INPUTS
	l - pointer to a layer
	flag - use TRUE if update was completed. The damage list is cleared.
	       use FALSE if update not complete. The damage list is retained.

    EXAMPLE

	-- begin update for first part of two-part refresh --
	BeginUpdate(my_layer);

	-- do some refresh, but not all --
	my_partial_refresh_routine(my_layer);

	-- end update, false (not completely done refreshing yet) --
	EndUpdate(my_layer, FALSE);

	-- begin update for last part of refresh --
	BeginUpdate(my_layer);

	-- do rest of refresh --
	my_complete_refresh_routine(my_layer);

	-- end update, true (completely done refreshing now) --

	                 a0

	LONG FattenLayerInfo( struct Layer_Info *);
	OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE

    FUNCTION
	V1.1 software and any later releases need to have more info in the
	Layer_Info structure. To do this in a 1.0 supportable manner requires
	allocation and deallocation of the memory whenever most
	layer library functions are called.  To prevent unnecessary
	allocation/deallocation FattenLayerInfo will preallocate the
	necessary data structures and fake out the layer library into
	thinking it has a LayerInfo gotten from NewLayerInfo.
	NewLayerInfo is the approved method for getting this structure.
	When a program needs to give up the LayerInfo structure it
	must call ThinLayerInfo before freeing the memory. ThinLayerInfo
	is not necessary if New/DisposeLayerInfo are used however.

    INPUTS
	li - pointer to LayerInfo structure

	oldclipregion = InstallClipRegion( l,  region )
	d0                                 a0  a1

	struct Region *InstallClipRegion( struct Layer *, struct Region *);

    FUNCTION
	Installs a transparent Clip region in the layer. All
	subsequent graphics calls will be clipped to this region.
	You MUST remember to call InstallClipRegion(l,NULL) before
	calling DeleteLayer(l) or the Intuition function CloseWindow()
 	if you have installed a non-NULL ClipRegion in l.

    INPUTS
	l - pointer to a layer
	region - pointer to a region

    RESULTS
	oldclipregion - The pointer to the previous ClipRegion that
	    was installed. Returns NULL if no previous ClipRegion installed.

	    Note: If the system runs out of memory while computing the
	        resulting ClipRects the LAYERS_CLIPRECTS_LOST bit will
	        be set in l->Flags.

    BUGS
	If the system runs out of memory during normal layer operations,
	the ClipRect list may get swept away and not restored.
	As soon as there is enough memory and the layer library
	gets called again the ClipRect list will be rebuilt.

	d0                          a0     a1

	struct Hook *InstallLayerHook( struct Layer *, struct Hook *);

    FUNCTION
	Installs a new Layer->Backfill Hook, waiting until it is safe to do
	so. Locks the layer while substituting the new Hook and removing the
	old one. If a new Hook is not provided, will install the default layer
	BackFill Hook.

    INPUTS
	layer - pointer to the layer in which to install the Backfill Hook.
	hook -  pointer to layer callback Hook which will be called
	        with object == (struct RastPort *) result->RastPort
	        and message == [ (Layer *) layer, (struct Rectangle) bounds,
	                         (LONG) offsetx, (LONG) offsety ]

	        This hook should fill the Rectangle in the RastPort
	        with the BackFill pattern appropriate for offset x/y.

	        If hook is LAYERS_BACKFILL, the default backfill is
	        used for the layer.  (Same as pre-2.0)

	        As of V39:
		If hook is LAYERS_NOBACKFILL, the layer will not be
	        backfilled (NO-OP).

    RESULTS
	oldhook - pointer to the Layer->BackFill Hook that was previously
	          active.  Returns NULL if it was the default hook.
		  In V39, it could return 1 if there was no hook.

    EXAMPLE
	The following hook is a very simple example that does rather little
	but gives the basis idea of what is going on.

    NAME
	InstallLayerInfoHook - Install a backfill hook for non-layer      (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	oldhook=InstallLayerInfoHook(li,hook)
	d0                           a0 a1

	struct Hook *InstallLayerInfoHook(struct Layer_Info *,struct Hook *);

    FUNCTION
	This function will install a backfill hook for the Layer_Info
	structure passed.  This backfill hook will be used to clear the
	background area where no layer exists.  The hook function is
	passed the RastPort and the bounds just like the layer backfill
	hook.  Note that this hook could be called for any layer.

    INPUTS
	li - pointer to LayerInfo structure

	hook -  pointer to layer callback Hook which will be called
	        with object == (struct RastPort *) result->RastPort
	        and message == [ (ULONG) undefined, (struct Rectangle) bounds ]

	        This hook should fill the Rectangle in the RastPort
	        with the BackFill pattern appropriate for rectangle given.

	        If hook is LAYERS_BACKFILL, the default backfill is
	        used.  (Same as pre-2.0)

		If hook is LAYERS_NOBACKFILL, there will be no
	        backfill.  (NO-OP).

    RESULTS
	oldhook - Returns the backfill hook that was in the Layer_Info.
	          Returns LAYERS_BACKFILL if the default was installed.
	          Returns LAYERS_NOBACKFILL if there was a NO-OP hook.
	          Returns -1 if there was some failure.

    EXAMPLE
	See the example in InstallLayerHook.  Note that both the Layer
	pointer and the OffsetX/Y values are not available in the
	LayerInfo backfill hook.

    NOTES
	When the hook is first installed, it is *NOT* called.  It is up
	to the application to know if it is safe to fill in the area.
	Since the hook will be called when a layer is deleted, the easiest
	way to have layers call this hook is to create and delete a backdrop
	layer that is the size of the area.

	Also, note that currently the first long word of the hook message
	contains an undefined value.  This value may look like a layer pointer.
	It is *not* a layer pointer.

	The RastPort you are passed back is the same one passed to the
	function.  You should *not* use "layered" rendering functions
	on this RastPort.  Generally, you will wish to do BitMap operations
	such as BltBitMap().  The callback is a raw, low-level rendering
	call-back.  If you need to call a rendering operation with a
	RastPort, make sure you use a copy of the RastPort and NULL the
	Layer pointer.

    NAME
	LockLayer -- Lock layer to make changes to ClipRects.

    SYNOPSIS
	LockLayer( dummy, l )
	           a0     a1

	void LockLayer( LONG, struct Layer *);

    FUNCTION
	Make this layer unavailable for other tasks to use.
	If another task is already using this layer then wait for
	it to complete and then reserve the layer for your own use.
	(this function does the same thing as graphics.library/LockLayerRom)

	Note: if you wish to lock MORE THAN ONE layer at a time, you
	    must call LockLayerInfo() before locking those layers and
	    then call UnlockLayerInfo() when you have finished. This
	    is to prevent system "deadlocks".

	Further Note: while you hold the lock on a layer, Intuition will block
	    on operations such as windowsizing, dragging, menus, and depth
	    arranging windows in this layer's screen.  It is recommended that
	    YOU do not make Intuition function calls while the layer is locked.

    INPUTS
	dummy - unused
	l - pointer to a layer

    NAME
	LockLayerInfo -- Lock the LayerInfo structure.

    SYNOPSIS
	LockLayerInfo( li )
	               a0

	void LockLayerInfo( struct Layer_Info *);

    FUNCTION
	Before doing an operation that requires the LayerInfo
	structure, make sure that no other task is also using the
	LayerInfo structure.  LockLayerInfo() returns when the
	LayerInfo belongs to this task.  There should be
	an UnlockLayerInfo for every LockLayerInfo.

	Note: All layer routines presently LockLayerInfo() when they
	start up and UnlockLayerInfo() as they exit.  Programmers
	will need to use these Lock/Unlock routines if they wish
	to do something with the LayerStructure that is not
	supported by the layer library.

    FUNCTION
	Support routine useful for those that need to do some
	operations not done by the layer library.  Allows programmer
	to swap the contents of a small BitMap with a subsection of
	the display. This is accomplished without using extra memory.
	The bits in the display RastPort are exchanged with the
	bits in the ClipRect's BitMap.

	Note: the ClipRect structures which the layer library allocates are
	actually a little bigger than those described in the graphics/clip.h
	include file.  So be warned that it is not a good idea to have
	instances of cliprects in your code.

    INPUTS
	rp - pointer to rastport
	cr - pointer to cliprect to swap bits with

    NOTE
	Because the blit operation started by this function is done asynchronously,
	it is imperative that a WaitBlit() be performed before releasing or using
	the processor to modify any of the associated structures.
