    NAME
        speedbar_gc -- create speedbar BOOPSI objects

    SUPERCLASS
        gadgetclass

    REQUIRES
        bevel.image

    DESCRIPTION
        This classes provides a simple way to create and manage
        "Speed Bars", also commonly called Button Bars, Tool Docs, etc.

        A speed bar is a horizontal row or vertical column of button
        gadgets, usually with an image face denoting some program function.
        The speedbar gadget could be placed in the main programs window
        or perhaps its own window to form a floating speedbar/tooldoc.

        An advantages that this class provides:

         > Speedbar button strip created & removed as a single gadget.

         > Help strings for each button can be provided, and displayed
           in a window title bar while a button is depressed.

         > Supports Right Mouse Button abort.

         > Supports window relativity.

         > Custom centered images.

         > Ability to change background color of the speed bar strip
           or use fill hook pattern.

         > Horizontal or Vertical speed bar orientation.

         > Supports hiding and exposing speed buttons in the bar.

         > Supports scrolling additional speed buttons in to view
           via holding down the SHIFT key while clicking and
           dragging the mouse left/right or up/down depending on
           the SPEEDBAR_Orientation setting.

         > Supports OM_NOTIFY and may be attached to either
           button.gadget, scroller.gadget and/or propgclass to scroll
           the speed buttons if more buttons exist that are visible
           within its bounds. However, this as a slight unresolvable bug.

    ATTRIBUTES
        SPEEDBAR_Buttons (struct List *)
            An Exec list.  Nodes in this list must be allocated with
            AllocSpeedButtonNodeA().

            See the included SpeedBarTest.c example for additional information.
            Passing a NULL list will remove all buttons from the speedbar and
            detatch the buttons.  Passing ~0 will detach all buttons but not
            erase the display, useful when working on the list data, or while
            changing button lists.

            Applicability is (OM_NEW,OM_SET,OM_GET)

        SPEEDBAR_Orientation (WORD)

            Defaults to NULL.

            Applicability is (OM_NEW,OM_SET,OM_GET)

            NOTE: SPEEDBAR_Screen is *NOT* implemented.

        SPEEDBAR_StrumBar (BOOL)
            Enable "strumming" mode, where by you can drag the mouse
            over the button bar to view the help titles and release
            mouse button select the speed button under the mouse.
         
            Defaults to FALSE.

            Applicability is (OM_NEW,OM_SET)

            NOTE: SPEEDBAR_StrumBar has been disabled to support other
                  features available now, and in the future.

        SPEEDBAR_OffButton (SHORT)
            Disconnect a specified button ID from the speedbar display,
            but does not remove or deallocate button from the list.

            Applicability is (OM_SET, OM_UPDATE)

        SPEEDBAR_OnButton (SHORT)

        SPEEDBAR_BevelStyle (WORD)
            Set bevel box style around the speed bar. In some cases
            complex speedbars might be built via a series of speedbars
            in a layout object group and it would be desirable to
            select other bevel styles such as BVS_NONE, which under any
            bevel style preferences in use, it will not render a bevel.

            Defaults to BVS_BUTTON.

            Applicability is (ON_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)
speedbar_gc/SPEEDBAR_GetClass                   speedbar_gc/SPEEDBAR_GetClass

    NAME
        SPEEDBAR_GetClass -- Gets the pointer to the speedbar class. (V40)

    SYNOPSIS
        speedbar_class = SPEEDBAR_GetClass();
        D0

        Class * SPEEDBAR_GetClass(VOID);

    FUNCTION
        Obtains the pointer to the SpeedBar gadget class for use with
        NewObject().  This function always returns a valid pointer so
        you do not need to check it.  The reason is that if the library
        opens fine, then the pointer returned is already setup.  (Of course
        this implies that if opening the library fails, you shouldn't be
        calling this.)

        Note that this function does not create the class, that is done
        when the class library is opened.

    INPUTS
        Nothing.

    RESULT
        speedbar_class - Pointer to the SpeedBar gadget class.

speedbar_gc/AllocSpeedButtonNodeA          speedbar_gc/AllocSpeedButtonNodeA

    NAME
        AllocSpeedButtonNodeA -- Allocate a SpeedBar node. (V40)

    SYNOPSIS
        struct Node * AllocSpeedButtonNode(UWORD, Tag, ...)
        node = AllocSpeedButtonNode(number, Tag, ...)

        struct Node * AllocSpeedButtonNodeA(UWORD, struct TagItem *)
        node = AllocSpeedButtonNodeA(number, taglist)

    FUNCTION
        Allocates a node that can be added to the Exec linked list of
        labels in the speedbar.  This is the only way to allocate a
        node for this list, you cannot allocate nodes yourself because
        the SpeedBar class uses a private node structure.

    INPUTS
        number - Places value in node->sbn_Node.ln_Pri, and is the
            numeric ID of the button within the bar. Note the current
            limitation, ln_Pri is a BYTE. This will be addressed, and
            *posibly* made obsolete and overridden by SBNA_ButtonID.

        taglist - Attributes for the node, passed onto
            SetSpeedButtonNodeAttrsA().

    RESULT
        node - A node that can be added into the Exec list of labels for
            a SpeedBar gadget.

    NAME
        FreeSpeedButtonNode -- Free a SpeedBar node. (V40)

    SYNOPSIS
        VOID FreeSpeedButtonNode(struct Node *)
        FreeSpeedButtonNode(node)

    FUNCTION
        Frees a SpeedButtonNode allocated with AllocSpeedButtonNodeA().

    INPUTS
        node - The node to free.

    NAME
        GetSpeedButtonNodeAttrsA -- Get attributes about a SpeedBar node. (V40)

    SYNOPSIS
        VOID GetSpeedButtonNodeAttrs(struct Node *, Tag, ...)
        GetSpeedButtonNodeAttrs(node, firsttag, ...)

        VOID GetSpeedButtonNodeAttrsA(struct Node *, struct TagItem *)
        GetSpeedButtonNodeAttrsA(node, taglist)

    FUNCTION
        The SpeedBar uses a private node structure and all attributes
        are hidden, and must therefore be accessed with this function.

    INPUTS
        node - The SpeedBar node to get the information on.
        taglist - A tag list of attributes to get.  ti_Tag is the attribute
            to get and ti_Data is a pointer to a location to copy the result
            to.

    NAME
        SetSpeedButtonNodeAttrsA -- Set attributes of a SpeedBar node. (V40)

    SYNOPSIS
        VOID SetSpeedButtonNodeAttrs(struct Node *, Tag, ...)
        SetSpeedButtonNodeAttrs(node, firsttag, ...)

        VOID SetSpeedButtonNodeAttrsA(struct Node *, struct TagItem *)
        SetSpeedButtonNodeAttrsA(node, taglist)

    FUNCTION
        Changes attributes for a SpeedBar node.  Since the SpeedBar
        class uses a private node structure, this is the only way to change
        node attributes.

        You may NOT change node attributes when the node is in a list
        attached to a SpeedBar gadget.  You must first detach the list
        with SPEEDBAR_Labels, ~0 before you can change attributes, and
        then re-attach the list.
