    NAME
        penmap_ic -- create penmap BOOPSI objects

    SUPERCLASS
        imageclass

    REQUIRES
        None.

    DESCRIPTION
        This class will yield color remapped images on any public screen.
        It also supports bitmap scaling. If used with V39 or or greater
        of AmigaOS it can take advantage of pen sharing.

    METHODS
        OM_NEW -- Create the penmap image.  Passed to superclass,
            then OM_SET.

        OM_GET -- Get object attributes.  Passed to superclass first.

        OM_SET -- Set object attributes.  Passed to superclass first.

        OM_UPDATE -- Set object notification attributes.  Passed to
            superclass first.

        IM_DRAW -- Renders the image. Supports IDS_NORMAL and
            IDS_SELECTED drawing states, and does not require
            a DrawInfo structure. The graphics.library function
            BitMapScale () to scale the image if required.

        IM_DRAWFRAME -- Renders the image scaled to the frame size
            specified. Supports IDS_NORMAL and IDS_SELECTED drawing
            states, and does not require a DrawInfo structure.
            The graphics.library function BitMapScale () to scale
            the image.

        IM_HITFRAME -- Asks the object if a point would be inside it
            if the object was confined (scaled) to the given
            rectangular bounds. Returns TRUE if the given point would
            be inside the object, otherwise FALSE.

        IM_ERASEFRAME -- Erase the object using the rectangular
            frame size.

        All other methods are passed to the superclass, including OM_DISPOSE.

    ATTRIBUTES

        IA_Left (WORD)
        IA_Top (WORD)
            Set starting position/offset of image.
            Defaults to 0.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

        IA_Width (WORD)
        IA_Height (WORD)
            Set size of the image, scaling via BitMapScale() if different
            from the chunky image data size.

            Defaults to width and height of IA_Data.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

        IA_BGPen 
            Specify background pen of a normal image.

            Defaults to BACKGROUNDPEN of the screen passed in PENMAP_Screen.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_GET)

        IA_Pens
            Sets the pens which the values in the data array represents.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_GET)

        IA_Data
           Chunky format image data for normal render.
           
           The data format is a UBYTE array of chunky pen numbers.
           Note this data must be WORD aligned, as the first 4 bytes
           are accessed as two WORDs which specify the width and
           height of the following chunky image data.

           Defaults to NULL.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_SET)

        PENMAP_SelectedData
           Chunky format image data for selected image render.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_SET)

        PENMAP_Palette
           An array of ULONG describing the palette for the picture.
           If you are obtaining pens yourself, you should only pass the
           IA_Pens attribute at object creation time.

           The format of the array is:

           ULONG palette[] =
           {
               number_triplets,
               red1, green1, blue1,
               red2, green2, blue2,
               ...
           };

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_GET)

        PENMAP_Screen (struct Screen *)
            Pointer to the screen to use image on. This attribute MUST
            be provided when creating an object of this class.

           Defaults to NULL.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_GET)

        PENMAP_Transparent (BOOL)
           Remaps chunky pen 0 to the BACKGROUNDPEN.

           Defaults to FALSE.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_SET)

        PENMAP_Precision
            Set the precision for ObtainBestPen() when penmap is used
            under AmigaOS 3.0 or later. See the ObtainBestPen autodoc
            for more details.
            
            Defaults to PRECISION_IMAGE.

            Applicability is (OM_NEW, OM_SET)

        PENMAP_ColorMap (struct ColorMap *)
            Pointer to a colormap to use in obtaining best matching pens.
            This tag or, PENMAP_Screen must be provided when creating an
            object of this class. If PENMAP_Screen is passed, penmap will
            use Screen->ViewPort.ColorMap.

           Defaults to NULL.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_GET)

        PENMAP_MaskBlit (BOOL)
           Causes penmap to render on screen using a mask plane. This
           mask plane is created dynamically by the class.

           The mask is created by OR'ing the source bitplanes in to a single
           mask plane using some nifty blitting techniques. This tag should
           be used if penmap objects are used in a layout group that may
           contain a user or program specified backfill. This will allow the
           backfill pattern to flow around the image, making it transparent.

           Defaults to FALSE.

           (Applicability is OM_NEW, OM_SET)
penmap_ic/PENMAP_GetClass                   penmap_ic/PENMAP_GetClass

    NAME
        PENMAP_GetClass -- Gets the pointer to the penmap class.

    SYNOPSIS
        penmap_class = PENMAP_GetClass();
        D0

        Class * PENMAP_GetClass(VOID);

    FUNCTION
        Obtains the pointer to the PenMap image class for use with
        NewObject().  This function always returns a valid pointer so
        you do not need to check it.  The reason is that if the library
        opens fine, then the pointer returned is already setup.  (Of course
        this implies that if opening the library fails, you shouldn't be
        calling this.)

        Note that this function does not create the class, that is done
        when the class library is opened.

    INPUTS
        Nothing.

    RESULT
        penmap_class - Pointer to the PenMap image class.
