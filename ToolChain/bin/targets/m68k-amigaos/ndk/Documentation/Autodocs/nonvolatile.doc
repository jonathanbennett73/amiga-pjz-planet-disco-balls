   PURPOSE
	The nonvolatile library provides a simple means for an application
	developer to manage nonvolatile storage.

   OVERVIEW
	The nonvolatile library is meant to be used transparently across all
	configurations. Currently, nonvolatile storage may consist of NVRAM
	and/or disk devices. nonvolatile.library will automatically
	access the best nonvolatile storage available in the system. Disk
	based storage will be selected first and if not available, NVRAM
	storage will be accessed.

	* NVRAM

	On low-end diskless Amiga platforms, NVRAM may be available. This
	RAM will maintain its data contents when the system is powered down.
	This is regardless of whether batteries or battery-backed clock are
	present. The data stored in NVRAM is accessible only through the
	ROM-based nonvolatile library funtion calls. The size of NVRAM
	storage	is dependant on the system platform and is attainable through
	the GetNVInfo() function.

	* Disk

	In keeping with the general configurability of the Amiga, the actual
	disk location used by nonvolatile library when storing to disk may be
	changed by the user.

	The prefs directory is used on the Amiga for storing many user
	configurable options. The location for nonvolatile disk storage
	is contained in the file prefs/env-archive/sys/nv_location. This
	file should contain a data string that specifies a lockable location.
	If the string does not specify a lockable location, the file will
	be ignored.

	When opened, the nonvolatile library will search all drives within
	the system until it finds this file and successfully accomplishes
	a Lock on the location specified in the file. To force a rescan of
	all drives, the library may be closed and reopened or execute the
	GetNVInfo() function.

	A simple method for creating a floppy disk for saving nonvolatile
	data is the following:

	Format a disk with the volume name NV
	Create a file prefs/env-archive/sys/nv_location on this disk with
	  the following contents:  NV:nonvolatile
	Create a directory nonvolatile

	The following is a script file that can be used to make a floppy
	for use with nonvolatile library:

	.KEY DRIVE/A,DISK
	.BRA {
	.KET }
	format Drive {DRIVE} Name {DISK$NV} noicons ffs
	makedir {DRIVE}prefs
	makedir {DRIVE}nonvolatile
	makedir {DRIVE}prefs/env-archive
	makedir {DRIVE}prefs/env-archive/sys
	echo {DISK$NV}:nonvolatile >{DRIVE}prefs/env-archive/sys/nv_location

	!!!NOTE!!!

	Because NVRAM performs disk access, you must open and use its
	functionality from a DOS process, not an EXEC task.  Normally
	your CDGS application is invoked as a DOS process so this
	requirement generally should cause you no concern.  You just
	need to be aware of this requirement should you create an
	EXEC task and try to invoke nonvolatile.library from that task.

nonvolatile.library/DeleteNV                     nonvolatile.library/DeleteNV

		  created the data. Maximum length is 31.
	ItemName - NULL terminated string uniquely identifing the data
		   within the application. Maximum length is 31.
	killRequesters - suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system
			 requesters are to be suppressed during this function.
			 FALSE if system requesters are allowed.

   RESULT
	success - TRUE will be returned if the entry is found and deleted.
		  If the entry is not found, FALSE will be returned.

nonvolatile.library/FreeNVData                 nonvolatile.library/FreeNVData

   FUNCTION
	Frees a block of memory that was allocated by any of the following:
	GetCopyNV(), GetNVInfo(), GetNVList().

   INPUTS
	data - pointer to the memory block to be freed. If passed NULL,
	       this function does nothing.

   SEE ALSO
	GetCopyNV(), GetNVInfo(), GetNVList()

nonvolatile.library/GetCopyNV                   nonvolatile.library/GetCopyNV

   NAME
	GetCopyNV -- return a copy of an item stored in nonvolatile storage.
		     (V40)

   SYNOPSIS
	data = GetCopyNV(appName, itemName, killRequesters);
	D0		 A0	  A1	    D1

	APTR GetCopyNV(STRPTR, STRPTR, BOOL);

   FUNCTION
	Searches the nonvolatile storage for the indicated appName and
	itemName. A pointer to a copy of this data will be returned.

	The strings appName and itemName may not contain the '/' or ':'
	characters. It is recommended that these characters be blocked
	from user input when requesting appName and itemName strings.

   INPUTS
	appName - NULL terminated string indicating the application name
		  to be found. Maximum length is 31.
	itemName - NULL terminated string indicated the item within the
		   application to be found. Maximum length is 31.
	killRequesters - Suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system
			 requesters are to be suppressed during this function.
			 FALSE if system requesters are allowed.

   RESULT
	data - pointer to a copy of the data found in the nonvolatile storage
	       assocated with appName and itemName. NULL will be returned
	       if there is insufficient memory or the appName/itemName does
	       not exist.

nonvolatile.library/GetNVInfo                   nonvolatile.library/GetNVInfo

   NAME
	GetNVInfo -- report information on the current nonvolatile storage.
		     (V40)

   SYNOPSIS
	information = GetNVInfo(killRequesters);
	D0			D1

	struct NVInfo *GetNVInfo(BOOL);

   FUNCTION
	Finds the user's preferred nonvolatile device and reports information
	about it.

   INPUTS
	killRequesters - suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system
			 requesters are to be suppressed during this function.
			 FALSE if system requesters are allowed.

   RESULT
	information - pointer to an NVInfo structure. This structure contains
		      information on the NV storage media with the largest
		      storage. The structure contains 2 longword fields:
		      nvi_MaxStorage and nvi_FreeStorage. Both values are
		      rounded down to the nearest ten. The nvi_MaxStorage
		      field is defined as the total amount of nonvolatile
		      storage available on this device. The nvi_FreeStorage is
		      defined as the amount of available space for NVDISK or
		      the amount of non-locked storage for NVRAM. For NVDISK,
		      the nvi_FreeStorage takes into account the amount of
		      overhead room required to store a new App/Item. This
		      amount is 3 blocks to allow room for storing a new Item
		      file and possibly a new App directory. For NVRAM, the
		      amount of overhead is 5 bytes. However, the amount of
		      room required to store a new NVRAM item depends on the
		      length of the App and Item names. Refer to StoreNV()
		      function for storage details.

		      This function may return NULL in the case of failure.

nonvolatile.library/GetNVList                   nonvolatile.library/GetNVList

   NAME
	GetNVList -- return a list of the items stored in nonvolatile
		     storage. (V40)

   SYNOPSIS
	list = GetNVList(appName, killRequesters);
	D0		 A0	  D1

	struct MinList *GetNVList(STRPTR, BOOL);

   FUNCTION
	Returns a pointer to an Exec list of nonvolatile Items associated
	with the appName requested.

	The string appName may not contain the '/' or ':' characters.
	It is recommended that these characters be blocked from user input
	when requesting an appName string.

   INPUTS
	appName - NULL terminated string indicating the application name
		  to be matched. Maximum length is 31.
	killRequesters - Suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system
			 requesters are to be suppressed during this function.
			 FALSE if system requesters are allowed.

   RESULT
	list - a pointer to an Exec MinList of NVEntries. A NULL will be
	       returned if there is insufficient memory. If there are no
	       entries in the nonvolatile storage for the AppName, an
	       empty list will be returned.

   NOTE
	The protection field contains more bits than are required for
	storing the delete protection status. These bits are reserved
	for other system usage and may not be zero. When checking for
	the delete status use either the field mask NVIF_DELETE, or the
	bit definition NVIB_DELETE.

	FreeNVData(), SetNVProtection()

nonvolatile.library/SetNVProtection       nonvolatile.library/SetNVProtection

   NAME
	SetNVProtection -- set the protection flags. (V40)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = SetNVProtection(appName, itemName, mask, killRequesters);
	D0			  A0	   A1	     D2    D1

	BOOL SetNVProtection(STRPTR, STRPTR, LONG, BOOL);

   FUNCTION
	Sets the protection attributes for an item currently in the
	nonvolatile storage.

	Although 'mask' is LONG only the delete bit, NVEF_DELETE/NVEB_DELETE,
	may be set. If any other bits are set this function will return
	FALSE.

	The strings appName and itemName may not contain the '/' or ':'
	characters. It is recommended that these characters be blocked
	from user input when requesting AppName and ItemName strings.

   INPUTS
	appName - NULL terminated string indicating the application name
		  to be matched. Maximum length is 31.
	itemName - NULL terminated string indicated the item within the
		   application to be found. Maximum length is 31.
	mask - the new protection mask. Only set the delete bit otherwise
	       this function WILL CRASH.
	killRequesters - suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system
			 requesters are to be suppressed during this function.
			 FALSE if system requesters are allowed.

   RESULT
	success - FALSE if the protection could not be change (ie the data
		  does not exist).

	GetNVList(), <libraries/nonvolatile.h>

nonvolatile.library/StoreNV                       nonvolatile.library/StoreNV

   NAME
	StoreNV -- store data in nonvolatile storage. (V40)

   SYNOPSIS
	error = StoreNV(appName, itemName, data, length, killRequesters);
	D0		A0	 A1	   A2    D0	 D1

	UWORD StoreNV(STRPTR, STRPTR, APTR, ULONG, BOOL);

   FUNCTION
	Saves some data in nonvolatile storage. The data is tagged with
	AppName and ItemName so it can be retrieved later. No single
	item should be larger than one fourth of the maximum storage as
	returned by GetNVInfo().

	There is no data compression associated with this function.

	The strings, AppName and ItemName, should be short, but descriptive.
	They need to be short since the string is stored with the data and
	the nonvolatile storage for a stand alone game system is limited.
	The game system allows the user to selectively remove entries from
	storage, so the string should be desriptive.

	The strings AppName and ItemName may not contain the '/' or ':'
	characters. It is recommended that these characters be blocked
	from user input when requesting AppName and ItemName strings.

   INPUTS
	appName - NULL terminated string identifying the application
		  creating the data. Maximum length is 31.
	itemName - NULL terminated string uniquely identifying the data
		   within the application. Maximum length is 31.
	data - pointer to the memory block to be stored.
	length - number of bytes to be stored in the units of tens of
		 bytes. For example, if you have 23 bytes to store length = 3;
		 147 byte then length = 15.
	killRequesters - suppress system requesters flag. TRUE if all system
			 requesters are to be suppressed during this function.
			 FALSE if system requesters are allowed.

   RESULT
	error - 0                means no error,
	        NVERR_BADNAME    error in AppName, or ItemName.
	        NVERR_WRITEPROT  Nonvolatile storage is read only.
	        NVERR_FAIL       Failure in writing data (nonvolatile storage
				 full, or write protected).
	        NVERR_FATAL      Fatal error when accessing nonvolatile
				 storage, possible loss of previously saved
				 nonvolatile data.
