This drawer contains examples for language drivers, such as found in
"LOCALE:languages". Two examples are provided. One is a complete
language driver implementation, as contained in locale.library itself:
the "english.language" driver. The other example demonstrates how
a language driver can be implemented which supports only a subset of
the functions offered by the default language.
