This drawer contains a few test and demonstration programs for
workbench.library and its new V44 API. The programs will do the
following:

   AddHiddenDevice

      Add a device or volume to the list of devices Workbench
      should not display.

   ClockIcon

      This is a very simplistic and none too sophisticated
      example of a program which dynamically updates the appearance
      of an AppIcon.

   CloseWorkbenchObject

      This demonstrates how a Workbench drawer can closed under
      program control.

   GetHiddenDeviceList

      This prints the list of volumes and devices which Workbench
      should not display.

   GetOpenDrawerList

      This prints the list of drawer windows Workbench has
      currently open.

   GetProgramList

      This prints the list of programs that were launched from
      Workbench and are still running.

   GetSelectedIconList

      This prints the list of icons currently selected.

   MakeIconVisible

      This will make an icon entirely visible, if possible.

   OpenWorkbenchObject

      This demonstrates how drawers can be opened and how and programs
      can be launched by Workbench under program control.

   RemoveHiddenDevice

      Removes a device or volume from the list of devices Workbench
      should not display.

   SelectIcon

      This demonstrates how an icon can be selected under
      program control.
