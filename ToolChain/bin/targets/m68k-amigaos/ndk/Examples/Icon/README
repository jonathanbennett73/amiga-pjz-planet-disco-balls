This drawer contains a small collection of test programs for icon.library,
using the new V44 API. This what the programs do:

   BumpRevision

      Tests the BumpRevision() function.

   CondenseIcons

      Demonstrates the "space saving" features of PutIconTagList().

   Convert8ColorIcons

      Converts icons with more than four colours into the new palette
      mapped format. The program assumes a default colour palette.

   ConvertMagicWBIcons

      Converts icons in the MagicWB design into the new palette mapped
      mapped format.

   ConvertNewIcons

      Converts icons in the NewIcons format into the new palette mapped
      mapped format.

   GlowIconImage

      This program does not really operate on icons. It's useful for
      creating an image in the "glowing design", as used by the
      AmigaOS 3.5 Workbench design.

   IdentifyHook

      This demonstrates the icon identification hook feature of
      icon.library V44 by attaching default icons to files without
      icons, based upon their contents (by means of datatypes.library).

   ImageToIcon

      This program will read picture files and create icons from them,
      using the new palette mapped format supported by icon.library V44.

   LayoutIcon

      This demonstrates the use of the LayoutIconA() function
      supported by icon.library V44.

   MakeIconsBorderless

      This program will turn a bunch of palette mapped icons into
      borderless (or frameless) icons.

   MatchToolValue

      This program tests the MatchToolValue() function.

   StripIcons

      This program demonstrates how a new format palette mapped icon
      can be "degraded" into a standard icon, such as icon.library V37
      may write it.

   ToolTypes

      This demonstrates the FindToolType() function.
