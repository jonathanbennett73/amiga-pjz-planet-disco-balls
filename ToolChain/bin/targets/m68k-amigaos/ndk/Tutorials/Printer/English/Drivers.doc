printer.device V44 (OS 3.5)

Drivers for the new printer.device.

The new printer.device offers many new possibilities for printer
drivers and does away with some problems of the old printer.device.

Changes:

1. The driver now always runs in a DOS process with a minimum stack
size of 8 KB.

2. The PWrite and PBothReady functions can now sensibly used in
every situation, even during DoSpecial.

3. Due to an extension of the command table, accidental exchanges of
PWrite output from DoSepcial and printer.device output can be avoided.

4. Drivers can return error messages from all necessary situations
(including DoSpecial) and can use error codes of their own.

5. Drivers are resposible for formatting and localizing their error codes.

5. Drivers can perform color conversion, color correction, dithering etc.
by themselves without having to fear side-effects with the printer.device
or having to use the incovenient PDERR_TOOKCONTROL.

6. Scaling can be done entirely by printer.device but it is also possible
to request that no scaling be performed at all.

7. Drivers can use their own structure for color. This enables the use of
standard implementations for color space conversion etc.

8. Drivers can use the new PRead function to read from the I/O interface.

9. Drivers can influence the display of the printer preferences in order
to adapt them to their interpretation of the settings.

10. Drivers can manage their settings themselves and are allowed to have
a printer dialog of their own.

11. Drivers can return new information to applications in order to improve
the printing result.


Converting an old driver into a new driver

1. Set driver identification

A new driver must have a version number of 44 or better and must have the
PPCF_EXTENDED bit set in ped_PrinterClass. After that the PrinterExtendedData
structure must be extended with the following fields:

ped_TagList is a pointer to a tag list that contains for the most part
the extended driver definition.

ped_DoPreferences is a function pointer. The funtion is called in order to
manage the different commands for the driver-specific settings.

ped_CallErrHook is a function pointer. The function is called in order to
format driver-specific error codes and output it through a hook.

The tags of ped_TagList in full:

PRTA_8BitGuns: If the value of this tag is TRUE, every color will be computed
using 256 intensities. This makes up to 16 million colors possible (although
hardly any printer can print all of them). If this tag is not present or
FALSE, 16 intensities per color are used, just like in previous versions
of AmigaOS. New drivers should set this tag under any circumstances.

PRTA_ConvertSource: If the value of this tag is TRUE, printer.device
will leave the conversion from the sRGB color space into the printer-specific
color space (often YMCK) to the driver. The conversion will then be
performed by calling the ped_Render function with a status of 8.
The first parameter is a pointer to 24 bit BGR values (please note the
unuals BGR order which is used for compatibility reasons) the
second parameter contains the number of pixels in the array and the
third parameter is 0 if the array is a colormap or 1 if the the array
is a pixel lin. The size of each entry is given either by PRTA_ColorSize
or by sizeof(union colorEntry).

PRTA_FloydDithering: If the value of this tag is TRUE, the printer.device
will leave the floyd-steinberg dithering (or whatever dithering is used)
to the driver. If the PRTA_8BitGuns tag is TRUE, this tag is set to TRUE
implicitly, i.e. normally the driver itself is responsible for the third
dither method as well.

PRTA_AntiAlias: If the value of this tag is TRUE, the printer.device will
leave the smoothing to the driver. In this case the driver must perform
the smoothing in the render 1 call.

PRTA_ColorCorrection: If the value of this tag is TRUE, the printer.device
will leave any color correction to the driver. Due to the rudimentary nature
of the built-in color correction of the printer.device it is highly reccommended
to perform the color correction inside the driver - the color correction
of printer.device will almost never fulfill the needs of modern printers.
The color correction is performed by calling the ped_Render function
with a status of 9. The first parameter is a pointer to a color array,
the second parameter specifies the number of elements in the array and
the third parameter is 0 for a color map or 1 for a pixel line.

PRTA_NoIO: If the value of this tag is TRUE, no I/O device will be opened.
In this case the driver must not call PWrite, PBothRead or PRead. Any ouput
must be performed directly by the driver. In this way fax drivers or drivers
that place their ouput in a file will no longer unecessarily allocate I/O resources.

PRTA_NewColor: If the value of this tag is TRUE, printer.device will not care
for the colors after conversion anymore. This tag implies that the tags
PRTA_ConvertSource, PRTA_FloydDithering, PRTA_AntiAlias and
PRTA_ColorCorrection all have a value of true.

PRTA_ColorSize: The value of this tag defines the size of a color or a pixel.
The standard value is sizeof(union ColorEntry). With the help of this tag
the driver can save more information inside a color and support more
complex color spaces. If the driver doesn't have the PRTA_NewColor tag set
and uses one of the printer.device algorithms for conversion, correction or
anti-alias, every pixel will be interpreted as a ColorEntry union, even
if a larger value is used as the total size of a pixel. Therefore in most
cases it will be necessary to combine a color structure that is not identical
to union ColorEntry with the PRTA_NewColor tag.

PRTA_NoScaling: If a driver wants to inhibit any scaling of the raw data
by printer.device, it can do so by use of this tag. However, the scaling
will still be computed, i.e. the number printer columns and lines in
render case 1 will still be equal to the scaled values. The size of the
raw data can be obtained from the PrtInfo.pi_width and pi_height fields.
This tag automatically implies TRUE values for PRTA_FloydDithering and
PRTA_AntiAlias since these algorithms can only operate on scaled data.

PRTA_DitherNames: The value of this tag is an array of 3 strings - names
for the dithering methods PD_ORDERED, PD_HALFTONE and PD_FLOYD. If a
driver uses dithering methods different from those it should use the tag
in order to appropriately name the dither methods.

PRTA_ShadingNames: The value of this tag is an array of 4 strings - names
for the shading types PS_BW, PS_GREYSCALE, PS_COLOR and PS_GREY_SCALE2.
The last two strings are exchanged in their order compared to the order
used in the printer preferences! If a driver uses shading methods different
from the default (e.g. a special variant of grey values in the case of PS_COLOR
for black/white printers), it should use the tag to appropriately name
the shading methods. Please note that the PS_GREY_SCALE2 method is used
internally by printer.device as a special case for the A2024 grey scale
monitor, so that replacing this method does not make much sense.

PRTA_ColorCorrect: If a driver can not understand the separate setting of
color correction for the red, green and blue color channels, it should set
this tag to FALSE so that the checkmarks become disabled in the preferences.

PRTA_DensityInfo: Drivers that use the density settings to make further
changes to the output (e.g. amount of ink) can use this tag to provide
user information for every density. The value of this tag is an array of
8 string. The first string is currently ignored and must be NULL while
the other 7 strings correspond to the densities 1 to 7 and are displayed
accordingly by the printer preferences.

PRTA_LeftBorder, PRTA_TopBorder: Most printers have small paper margins.
The left and top border on the paper onto which the printer can not print
is specified in inches/1000 using these tags. The right and bottom margins
are set according to the printable area. Applications can use the information
on the margins and printable area to accurately place the printer output
on the paper.

PRTA_MixBWColor: If an application uses segemented (striped) printing it
can often significantly improve the printing speed if it prints segments
that contain only black graphics/text using the black/white mode of the
printer; segments with color graphics will be printed using the greyscale
or color mode accordingly. However, some printers use a different ink
cartrige for black/white printing than they use for color printing or
they use black ink in black/white mode and mix black from yellow,
cyan and magenta while in color mode. In both cases an optimization by
the application is undesirable. If the value of this tag is FALSE,
applications should refrain from performing such optimizations.

PRTA_Preferences: If the driver uses a driver-specific set of options and
if these options options can be changed via the driver, this tag displays
these circumstances with a value of TRUE. Applications will then allow
access to a button labelled "Options..." which allows the user to open
a window for editing the driver options. This is achieved by using the
new command PRD_EDITPREFS.


2. Adapt algorithms

The transfer function

The Transfer() function of the driver that is responsible to transfer the
pixels into the printer buffer does not need to perform scaling anymore.
Up to know the special case of X-stretching was left to the drivers. This
is now handled by the printer.device in all cases, the pi_ScaleX field only
contains ones so the the loop for using a specific X-value an corresponding
amount of times can be removed from the function.

New drivers should set the PRTA_8BitGuns tag and support printing with 256
intesities per color channel. Normally this shouldn't involve much work as
the typical transfer function will work just the same with 8 bits as it
does with 4.

Two points have to be taken into account, though: The threshold value
pi_Threshold has already been stretched to 256 intensities. Many drivers
invert this value before using it, so care must be taken to perform the
inversion in the correct range of values.

The dither matrices pi_dmatrix still correspond to the dither methods ordered
and halftone with a grid size of 4x4. Using these matrices results in a
maximum of 16 intensities per color channel in the final printout and thus
results in very marginal improvements when compared to the old drivers.
Instead you should use differently sized matrices depending on the print
resolution, e.g. 8x8. In the case of the Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm
the pi_dmatrix matrix will contain only averag intensities and is not
suitable for dithering.

Density calculation

The SetDensity function must adjust the values of the PRTA_Leftborder,
PRTA_TopBorder and PRTA_MixBWColor if these depend on the printing resolution.
However, this will not apply to most printers. Applications, on the other hand,
are encouraged to re-read theses values for every print density.

The render function

Two cases for the render function have been added:

Case 8: The function is called with status 8 if colors have to converted from
RGB to the format of the driver. The first parameter ct contains a pointer to
an array of color. Every entry has a size corresponding to the PRTA_ColorSize
tag or sizeof(union ColorEntry).
If you interpret the entries as a union ColorEntry the bytes with the indices
PCMRED, PCMGREEN, PCMBLUE will receive the RGB values. The x parameter holds
the number of entries in the array. The y parameter contains a 0 for a colormap
and a 1 for a line of pixels.

The standard conversion from RGB data to YMCK (as it is used in printer.device)
can look like this:

case 8:                  /* Convert RGB source to union ColorEntry */
{
	/*
	   ct       - union colorEntry *, pointer to RGB data
	   x        - width, number of colors in ct array
	   y        - 0: converting colormap, 1: converting pixel row
	*/
	union colorEntry *ColorInt = (union colorEntry *) ct;
	LONG width = x;
	ULONG additive = 0xffffffff;
	additive ^= (PD->pd_Preferences.PrintImage == IMAGE_NEGATIVE) ? 0xffffffff : 0;
	if (PD->pd_Preferences.PrintShade == SHADE_COLOR)
	{
		/* we don't need PCMBLACK, so don't calculate it */
		do
		{
			ColorInt->colorLong ^= additive;
			ColorInt++;
		}
		while (--width);
	}
	else
	{
		/* calculate PCMBLACK */
		do
		{
			ColorInt->colorLong ^= additive;
			ColorInt->colorByte[PCMBLACK] =
				(ColorInt->colorByte[PCMYELLOW]
				+ ColorInt->colorByte[PCMMAGENTA]
				+ ColorInt->colorByte[PCMCYAN]) / 3;
			ColorInt++;
		}
		while (--width);
	}
	break;
}

Especially the calculation of the grey scale value can differ from the simple
arithmetic average of the three color intensities.


Case 9: The function is called with status 9 if colors are to be corrected.
The first parameter ct contains a pointer to an array of colors in the format
of the driver (after render call 8). Every entry has the size specified by
the PRTA_ColorSize tag or sizeof(union ColorEntry).
The x parameter contains the number of entries in the array. The y parameter
is 0 for a color map and 1 for a line of pixels.

The DoSpecial function

If an entry in the command table "CommmandTable" contains "\377", the
DoSpecial() function will be called. What's new: if a command contains
the string "\377\377" the I/O buffers will be flushed prior to calling the
function. This enables the driver to perform I/O on its own by calling PWrite,
PBothReady and PRead, without any danger of the I/O becoming mixed up.

The result of the function is interpreted differently in order to enable
DoSpecial to return general printer errors:

Value        Interpretation
 >0           Number of characters in the buffer
  0           Command not handled by DoSpecial
 -1           Unsupported command
 -2           (new) Command was executed but no characters were written
                    to the buffer
<-2           (new) An I/O or printer error minus 65536.

In order to return an error from DoSpecial you simply have to subtract
65536 from the actual error code.


3. Error handling

The new ped_CallErrHook field of the PrinterExtendedData structure contains
a function which is called if an error code of the driver needs to formatted
for output via a hook.

The driver can define error codes between PDERR_FIRSTCUSTOM and PDERR_LASTCUSTOM
and return them from its functions. If the application has set a hook to output
an error directly through the printer.device, the ped_CallErrHook function will
be called for all error codes of the driver.

The first parameter of the function is a pointer to the I/O request that receives
the error in io_Error. The second parameter is the hook that was set by the
applicatioin. The driver must fill in a variable of PrtErrMsg type and then
call the pd_CallErrHook function of the PrinterData structure. This will in
turn contain the hook as the first parameter, the I/O request as the second
parameter and a pointer to a variable of PrtErrMsg type as the third parameter.
des Typs PrtErrMsg.

void ErrHook(struct IORequest *ior, struct Hook *hook)
{
	struct EasyStruct es;
	struct PrtErrMsg pem;
	LONG args[2];
	es.es_StructSize = sizeof(es);
	es.es_Flags = 0;
	es.es_Title = NULL;
	es.es_GadgetFormat = "OK";
	pem.pe_Version = PDHOOK_VERSION;
	pem.pe_ErrorLevel = RETURN_FAIL;
	pem.pe_Window = NULL;
	pem.pe_ES = &es;
	pem.pe_IDCMP = NULL;
	pem.pe_ArgList = NULL;
	switch (ior->io_Error)
	{
		case FILEERR_FILEOPENFAILED:
			es.es_TextFormat = "Unable to open file %s.";
			args[0] = (LONG) outfile;
			pem.pe_ArgList = args;
			break;
	}
	PD->pd_CallErrHook(hook,ior,&pem);
}

The es.es_Title and es.es_GadgetFormat fields may be NULL, the pd_CallErrHook
will fill them appropriately before calling the hook.


4. Driver settings

If the driver support proprietary (driver-specific) settings it must set
the PRTA_Preferences to TRUE and enter a function into ped_DoPreferences
that handles the settings.

Drivers can support different concepts for settings. If the driver is likely
to be used by several units it should save a separate pareferences file
for each unit. If it is likely to be used by only one unit it is sufficient
to use one preferences file. If the driver derives the name of the settings
file from the driver name, the user will still be able to manage several
sets of preferences by duplicating the driver and giving it a new name.

Another decision has to be made with regard to the size of the preferences
dialog. If the driver supports a very large amount of settings it often
makes sense for the driver to provide a separate preferences editor (e.g.
PrinterPS) that can be used to control all settings. In this case the dialog
that is opened by the PRD_EDITPREFS command should only contain that part
of the settings that directly affects the printer output.

The ped_DoPreferences function is called using 2 parameters: one I/O request
and one command. The command can state 7 different cases:

Case 0: set the preferences to their default values (PRD_RESETPRFS)

Case 1: load the preferences from a file (PRD_LOADPREFS)

Case 2: store the preferences in a file in ENV: (PRD_USEPREFS)

Case 3: store the preferences in a file both in ENV: and in ENVARC:
        (PRD_SAVEPREFS)

Case 4: store the preferences into an I/O buffer (PRD_READPREFS)

Case 5: copy the preferences from an I/O buffer (PRD_WRITEPREFS)

Case 6: open a window in which the preferences can be changed
        (PRD_EDITPREFS)


Details of the preferences structure

A structure that is used for saving the preferences must be derived from
the PrtDriverPreferences structure (Include devices/prtbase.h):

struct PrtDriverPreferences 
{
	UWORD    pdp_Version;       /* PRIVATE! driver specific version */
	UBYTE    pdp_PrinterID[32]; /* PRIVATE! driver specific id */
	char     pdp_PrefName[FILENAME_SIZE-16];
	ULONG    pdp_Length; /* length of this structure */
	/* more driver private fields follow*/
};

By reading the version and printerID the driver can tell its settings from
that of other drivers and can recognize older settings.

The PrefName array should contain a readable name for the preferences, this
could e.g. be the name of the printer.

Default values

In the beginning many programs will not offer the possibility to open the
preferences dialog (case 6). Therefore it is vital that the default values
actually make sense and are usable.

Loading and saving of preferences

The settings of a driver will automatically be loaded when opening a unit.
The file format should be an IFF FORM PREF and be structured the same way
the system files are (i.e. it should contain a FORM PRHD and a separate FORM
for the actual settings).

Reading and writing of preferences

An application may read the settings of the driver and store it for later
reference (e.g. to save it while the unit is closed). Likewise it may
write back the settings to the driver.

case 4:
	/* copy preferences to ior */
	sior = (struct IOStdReq *) ior;
	if (sior->io_Data && sior->io_Offset == 0 && sior->io_Length >= sizeof(DriverPrefs))
	{
		CopyMem(&DriverPrefs,sior->io_Data,sizeof(DriverPrefs));
		sior->io_Actual = sizeof(DriverPrefs);
	}
	else
		error = IOERR_BADLENGTH;
	break;
case 5:
	/* check prefs in ior and copy it to preferences */
	sior = (struct IOStdReq *) ior;
	if (sior->io_Data && sior->io_Offset == 0 && sior->io_Length >= sizeof(struct PrtDriverPreferences))
	{
		tp = (struct FileDriverPrefs *) sior->io_Data;
		/* check prefs data. If this check fails 0 is returned but
		   io_Actual is set to 0.
		*/
		if (checkDriverPrefs(&tp->fdp_Base))
		{
			CopyMem(tp,&DriverPrefs,sizeof(DriverPrefs));
			sior->io_Actual = sizeof(DriverPrefs);
		}
		else
			sior->io_Actual = 0;
	}
	else
		error = IOERR_BADLENGTH;
	break;

Damit der Treiber seine Einstellungen wiedererkennt, muß er den Kopf der
Datenstruktur überprüfen:

static int
checkDriverPrefs(struct PrtDriverPreferences *p)
{
	if (p->pdp_Version == 1
		&& strcmp(p->pdp_PrinterID,DriverPrefsDefault.fdp_Base.pdp_PrinterID) == 0
		&& p->pdp_Length == sizeof(struct FileDriverPrefs))
	{
		return TRUE;
	}
	return FALSE;
}

Please note that in the case of an unrecognized structure no error will
be returned but only io_Actual is set to 0. This means that the application
can write back settings that were stored earlier (even in a file) - this
makes a change or update of the driver "in between" possible.

Edit preferences

The I/O request for editing preferences (struct IOPrtPrefsReq) contains
a tag list:

PPRA_Window: The value of this tag denotes a window. This window determines
the screen to use for the preferences dialog. The window should be locked
against input as long as the dialog remains opened.

PPRA_Screen: If now window was specified this tag can be used to specify
a screen on which to open the preferences dialog.

PPRA_PubScreen: The name of a public screen on which to open the
preferences dialog.

The only ways to leave the preferences dialog should be by way of an "OK"
and a "Cancel" button, i.e. the settings will not be saved from within
the dialog. The saving of the settings must be handled either by the
application through PRD_READPREFS/PRD_WRITEPREFS, by a separate preferences
editor or by a system application using PRD_SAVEPREFS.


5. Driver-specific color structure

A driver can define a color structure best suited to its needs, i.e. it
need not use the standard union colorEntry structure. All printer.device
needs to know is the size of the structure which is achieved by use of
the PRTA_ColorSize tag. This of course means that the printer.device can
only provide a very limited amount of services to the driver:
Reading the bitmap and converting the data to 24 bit RGB and scaling the
RGB data. All other tasks (converting from sRGB color space to the printer
color space, color correction, dithering, anti-alias) must be performed
by the driver.

If the driver uses a color structure that is different from union colorEntry
it must set the PRTA_NewColor tag. The printer.device will then implicitly
set all tags that affect the printing algorithms.

If the driver only requires some addtionals bytes in the color structure,
e.g. for temporary data while dithering, it can use PRTA_ColorSize to
set the size of the new color structure but leave PRTA_NewColor set to
FALSE. Please note that in this case the color structure must begin with
union colorEntry because this is the way the printer.device interprets
the structure:

struct LargeColorEntry
{
	union colorEntry lce_ColorEntry;
	LONG lce_Random;
};
