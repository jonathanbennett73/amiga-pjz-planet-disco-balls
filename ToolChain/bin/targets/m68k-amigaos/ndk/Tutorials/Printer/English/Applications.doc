Changes for the printer preferences

The new version of printer.device brings some changes to the printer
preferences.

1. printer.device supports 10 units - each unit has its own set of preferences
associated with it, each of which can be set by the user using the "printer"
preferences. Opening printer.device and reading the settings functions the
same as in previous version with the single difference that these actions
can be performed on each of the 10 units. In order to select the unit to
choose there are two possibilities:

A. Simple unit selection by number, e.g. as an integer gadget.

B. Comfortable selection using a popup menu displaying the names that
the user can assign to each unit. In order to do this, the preference
files ENV:Sys:printer.prefs (for unit 0) and ENV:Sys/printer1.prefs
through ENV:Sys/printer9.prefs must be read. All of these files are
IFF files and may possibly contain a FORM PDEV. This FORM will then
contain the following structure (include file prefs/printertxt.h):
folgende Struktur (Includedatei prefs/printertxt.h):

struct PrinterDeviceUnitPrefs
{
	LONG	pd_Reserved[4];
	LONG	pd_UnitNum;
	UBYTE	pd_UnitName[UNITNAMESIZE];
};

The pd_UnitNum field contains the unit number, the pd_UnitName filed contains
the symbolic name. However, this string may be empty (pd_UnitName[0] == 0) in
which case a replacement text must be used (e.g. Unit N where N is the actual
unit number).

The following program will read the names of all 10 units from the preferences
files and print them to the console. The name will be replaced with "Unit N"
(where N is the unit number) if the user did not specify a name for the unit.

}

Any application should read this list not only upon start up but also every
time something is printed, e.g. when opening the printer dialog. This enables
the list to reflect any name changes the user might have made in the preferences
since the list was last read.

2. The past has shown that the printer preferences do not provide enough
options. Therefore many printer drivers interpret the settings in a different
way. This can easily confuse the user (e.g. when two identical densities
represent different amounts of ink usage). Drivers are now able to provide
such information to the application which in turn can display it in the
printer settings.

In order to achieve this, a distinction between old and new drivers must be
made. New drivers are recognized by their version (>= 44) and the PPCB_EXTENDED
flag in the PrinterExtendedData structure (include devices/prtbase.h). If this
is the case, the driver will include a new field called ped_TagList. This
taglist stores some information that is important for the printer preferences.

PRTA_DitherNames: The value of this tag is an array of 3 STRPTRs and
holds the names for the three possible dither settings. Up to now these
always were "Ordered", "Halftone" and "Floyd-Steinberg". The driver can now
assign new names that reflect the way the driver interprets these settings.

PRTA_ShadingNames: The value of this tag is an array of 4 STRPTRs and is
used to hold the new names for the 4 possible shading options. In previous
versions these were always "Black & White", "Grey Scale 1", "Colored" and
"Grey Scale 2". This is the actual order, although in the preferences they
usually were re-ordered to "Black & White", "Grey Scale 1", "Grey Scale 2"
and "Colored". The array uses the order first referred to. The driver is
now allowed to assign new names that better reflect its interpretation of
the settings (e.g. for printers that don't support color but several
grey scale qualities).

PRTA_ColorCorrect: If the value of this tag is FALSE, the three checkmarks
for red, green and blue correction should always be disabled. This means that
the driver does either not support color correction or that it uses different
settings to control them.

PRTA_DensityInfo: The value of this tag is an array of 8 STRPTRs. The first
string is currently unused, the following 7 provided additional information
for the print densities 1 to 7. Many drivers use the density settings not
only to choose the density but also other settings that affect the print
qualitiy (e.g. the amount of ink to use for printing). The strings in this
array are meant to inform the user of such circumstances. The preferences
should of course still report the selected density in DPI (e.g. 300 x 300 DPI)
which can be read from PrinterExtendedData.

PRTA_Preferences: If the value of this TAG is TRUE the driver supports a set
of proprietary printer options. If the tag is true, the printer preferences
should enable a button gadget called "Options..." which can be used to edit
the additional options. Further explanation on this topic can be found several
paragraphs below.


Changes regarding printing

Printing of text has remained entirely unchanged.

Graphics printing now allows the use of RTG bitmaps. Support is provided
for all RTG system which support the CyberGFX API cybergraphics.library.
If an application previously performed printer ouput using a planar bitmap
or converted an RTG bitmap to a color depth of 12 or 8 bits, it can now
be adapted to directly print RTG bitmaps. For high (16 bits) and true (24 or
32 bits) color bitmaps a color map need not be specified.

The new command PRD_DUMPRPORTTAGS extendeds the old PRD_DUMPRPORT command
by one tag list. Currently 3 tags are defined and implemented:

DRPA_SourceHook: The value for this tag must be a pointer to a struct hook.
This hook will be called in order to read the source data. The hook contains
a NULL object and a message that is a pointer to struct DRPSourceMsg.
This structure contains the position and size of the array to read as well
as a pointer to a field of ULONGs into which the data will be written.
This field has the exact size width*height that is contained in the message.
Every pixel will be stored as an ULONG of the form 0x00RRGGBB.

Typically the height will be 1 for normal printing while for landscape
printing the width will be 1. Applications are allowed to use special
optimizations for this case but they must always support the general
case as well.

If the DRPA_SourceHook is used, neither a RastPort nor a color map need
to be specified.

DRPA_AspectX, DRPA_AspectY: Using these tags you can control the aspect ratio
of the graphic. These values superseded those that are normally obtained from
the graphics mode (io_Modes) or the GfxBase. If the printing process suppresses
scaling the aspect ratio will be ignored.

Further information of the printer driver is in turn read from the driver's
tag list:

PRTA_LeftBorder and PRTA_TopBorder: Most printers have a small margin on the
paper to which they can not print. For modern printers this margin will usually
measure a few millimeters. If an application does not only show the printable
area of the paper but the entire page instead, it can now take this margin into
account: The tags specify the paper margins as inches/1000. This value must
be converted into the appropriate amount of pixels, depending on the print
resolution (LeftBorder*ped_XDPI/1000 or TopBorder*ped_YDPI/1000). Use this
values as the offset for the rastport the bitmap of which contains the entire
page while printing. This will cause the margin to be skipped while printing
and the hardcopy will match the screen display very closely.

PRTA_MixBWColor: If the value of this tag is TRUE, the application can
mix black/white and color printing at will. When printing segments an
application that has e.g. a lot of black text and only a few graphics in
the printer output (typical word processor) can significantly speed up the
printing process if segments that only contain black text on white paper
are printed using the black/white mode of the printer, while segments containg
both text and graphics are printed using the color mode. However, some printers
use different cartridges or inks, negating the speed gain or resulting in
poor quality of the hardcopy. Applications should forego this optimization
if the PRTA_MixBWColor has a value of FALSE.

One further piece of information is part of ped_PrinterClass and can also
be set for old drivers:

PPCB_NOSTRIPE: This flag denotes a printer driver that is not capable of
segmented (or striped) printing. The consequence is that all print data
must be passed to such a driver at once (which is inacceptable, especially
for color output and resolutions of 300 DPI and up) or the source hook
DRPA_SourceHook must be used "intelligently", i.e. when requesting data
through the source hook the data must be created accordingly by the application.

Please bear in mind that the source hook will always be called in the
context of the driver. This context is a DOS process with a stack of
currently 4 KByte. Depending on the concept of your application it may
be necessary to use an Exec message within the source hook to return
control to the application for creating a print segment.


Error handling

Error handling can now be left entirely to printer. device. Up to now the
printer.device or the printer driver could only return errors if the respective
error code was specified in exec/error.h or devices/printer.h. Using V44
of printer.device and new drivers new error messages can be returned as well.
The formatting of a localized error message can be performed by printer.device
or the driver while the ouput can also be performed by the printer.device or
the application.

The new command PRD_SETERRORHOOK expects an IOPrtErrReq structure for the
IO request:

struct IOPrtErrReq {
    struct  Message io_Message;
    struct  Device  *io_Device;     /* device node pointer  */
    struct  Unit    *io_Unit;       /* unit (driver private)*/
    UWORD   io_Command;             /* device command */
    UBYTE   io_Flags;
    BYTE    io_Error;               /* error or warning num */
    struct  Hook *io_Hook;
};

The io_Hook field can either contain the value PDHOOK_NONE in order
to disable automatic error handling or PDHOOK_STD in order to use an
easy-requester for displaying the error message or a pointer to a
structure hook. If an I/O operation of the printer.device ends with
an error, that hook will be called. The object contains a pointer to
the I/O request during which the error occured while the message
packet contains a pointer to an PrtErrMsg structure:

struct PrtErrMsg {
	ULONG pe_Version; /* Version of this struct */
	ULONG pe_ErrorLevel; /* RETURN_WARN, RETURN_ERROR, RETURN_FAIL */
	struct Window *pe_Window; /* window for EasyRequest() */
	struct EasyStruct *pe_ES;
	ULONG *pe_IDCMP;
	APTR pe_ArgList;
};

The pe_Version field containts the value PDHOOK_VERSION (currently 1).
pe_ErrorLevel contains RETURN_WARN, RETURN_ERROR or RETURN_FAIL in order to
reflect the severeness of the error. pe_Window contains a pointer to a
window or NULL, the window should be used in order to use the correct screen
for output. pe_ES contains a readily formatted EasyStruct structure
including the title and text for the error message. pe_IDCMP may contain
a pointer to a longword variable with IDCMP flags that are supposed to close
a requester while pe_ArgList contains a parameter field that must be used
for formatting the error message and the gadgets. All fields can be used
immediately for the EasyRequest() call.

The hook can be called in different tasks: either in the task that iniated
the I/O request or the process of the printer.device unit. In the second
the task is always a DOS process, allowing for file output and other DOS
calls. Please note, however, that no stdio is defined for that process.

The following source code is a hook that displays the error in an
easy-requester.

struct Task *ApplicationTask;

int easyRequestHook(struct Hook *, struct IORequest *ior, struct PrtErrMsg *msg)
{
	struct Task *me = ApplicationTask;
	if (me->tc_Node.ln_Type != NT_PROCESS
		|| ((struct Process *) me)->pr_WindowPtr != (struct Window *) -1)
	{
		struct Window *window = msg->pe_Window;
		if (!window && me->tc_Node.ln_Type == NT_PROCESS)
			window = ((struct Process *) me)->pr_WindowPtr;
		return EasyRequestArgs(msg->pe_Window, msg->pe_ES, msg->pe_IDCMP, msg->pe_ArgList);
	}
	return 0;
}

struct Hook StdErrorHook =
{
	{ NULL, NULL },
	(HOOKFUNC) HookEntry,
	(HOOKFUNC) easyRequestHook,
	NULL
};

This hook uses a global variable called ApplicatoinTask in order to determine
whether the error message should be suppressed (pt_WindowPtr == -1 in the
case of processes) and which window should be used for EasyRequestArgs in
order for the requester to open on the screen of that window. A similar
approach uses the PDHOOK_STD hook, but that one always refers to the task
that opened the unit.

The error hook must be set back to PDHOOK_NONE prior to closing the unit
of the printer device.


Driver-specfic settings

The printer settings of the "Printer" preferences do not suffice for many
modern printers and their drivers. Since version 2.1 AmigaOS has had a
separate preferences editor for the postscript printer driver that allows
more influence on printer output. In order to be able to change such
setting from within an application, three new printers commands appropriate
possibilities for the drivers are provided. In order to support these
possiblities, you must do the following from within your application.

1. Test whether the driver supports proprietary options. In this case
the PRTA_Preferences tag will be TRUE.

2. Provide an "Options..." button in your printer settings. Disable this button
for old drivers and drivers that do not provided proprietary options.

3. When the user click on the button lock the entire interface and use
the PRD_EDITPREFS command via DoIO to open the settings window. The DoIO
will return once the user has finished his changes to the settings.
The error will be PDERR_CANCEL if the user cancelled the dialog, or 0
otherwise (or another error). The PRD_EDITPREFS command expects a
IOPrtPrefsReq structure. This structure contains an additional field
called io_TagList and knows the following tags:

PPRA_Window: Pointer to a window that specifies the screen that is to be
locked against all input while the dialog is open.

PPRA_Screen: Pointer to a screen in case PPRA_Window is not specified.

PPRA_PubScreen: The name of a public screen in case PPRA_Window is not
specified.

4. If the settings made by the user should be saved or if the printer.device
is closed and re-opened between changing the settings, the application must
read the settings using the PRD_READPREFS command. The PRD_READPREFS command
expects an IOStdReq structure. In this context io_Data contains a pointer to
a buffer that is large enough to hold the data, io_Lenght contains the length
of the buffer, io_Offset must be 0. A length of 8 KB should be sufficient for
the most cases - in case the IOERR_BADLENGTH error is returned one should double
the buffer size and try again (until success).

LONG buflen = 8192;
LONG err;
for (;;)
{
	if (!(ior->io_Data = AllocVec(buflen,MEMF_PUBLIC)))
	{
		err = PDERR_BUFFERMEMORY;
		break;
	}
	ior->io_Length = buflen;
	ior->io_Offset = 0;
	if ((err = DoIO(ior)) != IOERR_BADLENGTH)
		break;
	FreeVec(ior->io_Data);
	buflen *= 2;
}

The number of bytes that were filled in the buffer is returned in io_Actual.
This buffer is absolutely private to the driver. It can only be kept in memory,
copied bytewise or saved to a file.

5. After opening a printer.device unit the settings that were previously
read can be written back. In order to do so, the PRD_WRITEPREFS command
is is used to return the buffer with the preferences to the driver in
an IOStdReq structure. In this case io_Data will point to the buffer,
io_Length denotes the number of filled bytes in the buffer (i.e. it
corresponds to the io_Actual of PRD_READPREFS).

If an application saves the settings to a file and re-uses them when it
is next used it is of course possible that the user has changed the driver
for that unit in the meantime. However, the drivers can determine on their
own whether or not the settings are meant for them. Therefore applications
need not worry about this case.
