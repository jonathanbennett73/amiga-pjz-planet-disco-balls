printer.device V44 (OS 3.5)

Preferences

The V44 printer.device supports 10 units. Each unit has its own set of
preferences associated with it. These are saved as follows:

The file ENV:Sys/printer.prefs contains all settings for unit 0. The file
ENV:Sys/printergfx.prefs has become obsolete. Any changes to this file are
still handled by IPrefs but are always overwritten by printer.prefs if this
file contains a FORM ID_PGFX.

The units 1 to 9 use the files ENV:Sys/printerN.prefs, where N is replaced
by the numbers 1 to 9.

Typically the files will containg the following FORMs:

ID_PRHD: struct PrefHeader containing version and type and flags all 0.

ID_PTXT: struct PrinterTxtPrefs containing the general printer settings
         and settings for text printing.

ID_PUNT: struct PrinterUnitPrefs containing the name and unit number of the device
         for printer output (parallel.device or serial.device, etc.).

ID_PDEV: struct PrinterDeviceUnitPrefs containing unit number and symbolic name
         for the unit of the printer.device. The name can be assigned by the
         user and provides more comfort when choosing units via the
         user interface.

ID_PGFX: struct PrinterGfxPrefs containing the settings for graphics printing.


Changes to the preferences

Only the SYS:Prefs/Printer program is allowed to make changes to the preferences
files and change their structure in the process. If another application wants
to change the settings (e.g. the printer driver, many fax programs do this),
it must preserve the structure of the file. This can be achieved by either
reading all FORMs consecutively and writing them in the same order, or by reading
the entire file into memory without dissolving its structure - it can the
be changed and written back.

The preferences files contain no CATs or LISTs, linearly reading all
FORMs and writing back all FORMs in the old order is therefore possible
and permitted.
